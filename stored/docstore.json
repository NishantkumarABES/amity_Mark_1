Narain\n\nhave sought to explore the relationships between the technological, hydrological\nand social dimensions of water management.1\nThe genesis of new paradigms influencing water resource policy and governance\nis a process in which both global and local actors have had a role to play (Narain\net al. 2014; Narayanan et al. 2014). Donors and funders have played a critical role\nin influencing the nature and direction of what are popularly called \u201cwater reforms\u201d.\nThey have played a key role in propagating new discourses around water resource\nmanagement. A case in point is the neo-liberal discourse propagated by the World\nBank and other international agencies that paved way for a greater role for the free\nmarket in the allocation of water resources. The neo-liberal discourse was founded\non the narrative of the weak and inefficient state, and the free market was seen as a\nnatural and obvious alternative. While the state was seen as playing a key role in the\nallocation and management of water resources in the country till the late 1980s, the\nneo-liberal discourse paved the way for a greater role for the free market in the\nperiod after that. Operationally, this created space for new actors in the governance\nof water resources. This took the form of outright privatization, for instance, and\nspawned debates regarding its equity and justice dimensions (Urs and Whittel\n2009). Autonomous forms of water markets have nevertheless functioned for several decades in the form of water tankers meeting the demand \u2013 supply gap for\ndrinking water in cities, as well as groundwater markets meeting the needs of smallholder irrigators. Both these forms of markets have, however, functioned outside\nany regulatory environment, raising questions about their equity, efficiency and sustainability implications (Shah 1993; Dubaash 2002; Prakash 2005).\nAlong the continuum of state and market based allocation of water, a distinct\nspace was created for user or community based organizations for water management. This emphasis stemmed from a realization that communities were capable of\ncrafting their own rules for resource appropriation and management (Ostrom 1990,\n1992). The positive evidence generated by farmer-managed irrigation systems in\nIndia provided the basis for the underlying narratives for policies for decentralization in irrigation management. This narrative was propagated by donors and funders;\nNGOs played their part in mobilising communities for irrigation management,\nwhile lobbying with state governments to put in place appropriate policies (Narain\n2003; Shashidharan 2000). Thus, the social engineering paradigm took shape, based\non the premise that institutions for collective management of water could be\n\u201cdesigned\u201d or \u201cengineered\u201d, often along the lines of models or prototypes.2\nIn the late 1990s, this culminated in serious efforts at establishing water users\nassociations in irrigation management. The IndianPIM, Indian Network for\nParticipatory Irrigation Management, gave a call for speedy upscaling and replication of water users associations, as if it were a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 panacea for the ills\nof the irrigation sector (Narain 2003). However, by the turn of the millennium, the\neuphoria surrounding water users\u2019 associations seemed to have considerably died\n1\n\nAs an example, see Roth and Vincent (2013). See also Narain (2003), Prakash (2005), Mehta\n(2005) and Dubaash (2002).\n2\nFor a discussion on the importance of models for irrigation management transfer in debates on\nirrigation reform, see Mollinga (2001). See also Parthasarathy (1998).\n\n \n1\n\nIntroduction: Towards a Discursive Analysis of Indian Water Policy\n\n3\n\ndown. Several factors were found to limit the effectiveness and success of water\nusers\u2019 associations,, including limited attention to the implications of design or the\ntechnology of irrigation systems in irrigation management transfer programmes, the\nperpetuation of unequal power structures in the functioning of water users\u2019 associations, poor consideration of the implications of WUA formation for water rights and\nentitlements, the influence of local politics, and resistance within the bureaucracy to\nsupport WUA formation (Narain 2003, 2004, 2008; Mollinga 2001; Jairath 1999;\nParthasarathy 1998).\nIn more recent years, several new subjects have come up surrounding the question of appropriate forms of water governance. These concern the role of regulatory\nauthorities as well as the functioning of public-private partnerships.

Critics, however, argue that public-private partnerships provide a form of\ndisguised privatization, or \u2018privatization by the back-door\u2019.\nWhile there have been experiments both with public-private partnerships as well\nas with privatization, the latter has met with more explicit resistance. This resistance\nstems from the inability of the market to deliver a good as basic as water to those\nwho are unable to pay for it (Urs and Whittel 2009; Kulkarni 2014). Water problems\nare rightly clubbed as \u201cwicked problems\u201d, denying clear-cut solutions or outcomes\n(Gyawali 2014; Mosse 2009). This \u2018wicked nature\u2019 stems from the multi-dimensional\nnature of the resource \u2013 from its possessing economic, social, cultural and political\nvalues all at the same time.\nWhile there has been a recent nod of approval from the judiciary on the subject\nof the inter-linking of India\u2019s rivers, this proposal presents a very good example of\npolarised views on what constitutes the \u201cright way\u201d to solve India\u2019s water problems.\nThe proposal for inter-linking of rivers has been founded on the narrative that India\u2019s\nwater problems are predominantly of a physical nature and that solutions lie in ameliorating the imbalance in the availability of water, transferring water from surplus\nto deficit basins. Water scholars have nevertheless challenged this narrative, asserting that the scarcity of water is a social construction as much as a physical one\n(Mehta 2005). In the context of the inter-linking of rivers, little attention has nevertheless been paid to the rights and equity dimensions of the water transfers envisaged; debates on the justice dimensions have stayed confined to issues of relocation\nand rehabilitation of displaced communities.\nWhile IWRM, or Integrated Water Resource Management, has been the dominant mantra or buzzword in water management in recent decades, there remains a\ncritical issue of deconstructing its components and depoliticising the discourse,\nwhile placing it in the Indian context to study its applicability and relevance. On\nmany other subjects, such as water rights reform, the level of discourse has remained\nsomewhat static. While the rationale for a property rights structure has been built on\ngrounds of equity, efficiency and sustainability, questions are still raised on its practicability. New research \u2013 including that presented in this book, however, suggests\nthat recent technological interventions may lower the transaction costs of adminis-\n\n \n4\n\nV. Narain\n\ntering a water rights structure, even in Indian conditions where the large number and\ngeographical spread of water users is known to raise the transaction costs of administering such a system (Kumar et al. 2011).\nThe debate on the efficacy of different approaches to regulate groundwater has\ncontinued in the Indian water governance literature. Groundwater irrigation received\na big spurt after the green revolution boom of the 1960s. The high-yielding varieties\nof crops that the green revolution technology demanded required timely application\nof water. This could not be provided by canal irrigation systems, that operate under\nstate operated irrigation schedules. Besides, canal irrigation systems in India are\nprotective irrigation systems, aiming to supply water thinly over a large number of\nfarmers and a large geographical area (Jurriens et al. 1996). They are designed to\nmeet a fraction of the irrigator\u2019s crop water requirements, as against the goal of\nproductive irrigation. This created a stress on groundwater irrigation, that irrigators\nuse for the greater control that it provides on water availability.\nHowever, indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater has created a problem of\nsteadily falling water tables, especially in the context of India\u2019s agriculturally\nimportant states. This has implications for sustainability of the green revolution\nitself, but also has wider equity implications, as falling water tables place the\nresource out of the reach of the smaller and marginal farmers. There has been an\non-going debate among scholars of water governance in India on the appropriate\nways of arresting the problem of groundwater depletion, and this debate shall likely\ncontinue, even as climate change presents additional stresses on the resource.3 Other\nimportant subjects of debate in the realm of Indian water policy over recent years\nhave been the limited effectiveness of policies for combating water pollution, the\npersistence of a gap between the rhetoric and practice of gender mainstreaming and\nlimited attention to issues of equity and social justice in water planning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36bc2883-90fd-49b7-88b7-e6441be65992": {"__data__": {"id_": "36bc2883-90fd-49b7-88b7-e6441be65992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "530034fd-1dde-4b93-a5f3-08b81a273cb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67e452dddc7348c73bd6184fa3faa0b936863c474e2574d870a7b0efa62296d0"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2320e08-1dac-4228-b578-3ed1718d4c89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6bbce62a2733d83c137f23f3212635e43a2a906c89da26a282b81714deeeb95"}}, "hash": "016879f457c8462ef33b5a6cf8daba849f34dc1a52727d374d69d4ee75105ee6", "text": "1.1\n\nChanging Paradigms and Debates in Indian Water Policy\n\nThis book seeks to present the current debates on these and other subjects shaping\nthe governance of water resources in the country.

It provides 50 % of irrigation in India and\naccounts for about a third of total food crop production in the country (Shah 2009).\nWith growing dependence on the resource, however, groundwater has become at\nonce a critical and threatened resource, with \u2018competitive deepening\u2019 emerging as a\nmajor issue in select regions, and climate change acting as a further multiplier (Shah\n2009, 2013). There has been a debate spanning over four decades now in the country on appropriate approaches to regulate groundwater extraction. Authors have\ndebated the potency of various measures, ranging from spacing and licensing norms,\ncredit and electricity restrictions to the institution of a property rights structure\n(Shah 1993; Narain 1998, 2000; Saleth 1996; Kumar et al. 2011). A case has been\nmade for enabling and participatory approaches to address this problem, as against\ntechnocratic and engineering-focused control \u2013based approaches (Moench 1994).\nReviewing the current challenges in groundwater management in India and the\npotential of alternative approaches to tackle them, Nitin Bassi (Chap. 3) advocates\nthe enforcement of private and tradable water rights in groundwater as a means to\nbring about increase in farm outputs, while reducing aggregate demand for water.\nThis, he suggests needs to be complemented by a pro rata pricing of electricity in\nthe farm sector, and an improvement in the quality and reliability of supplied power.\nMaria Saleth (Chap. 9) looks more closely at the subject of a property rights\nstructure for water. While the case for a property rights structure has been made in\nthe Indian water governance and policy debate for several decades, Saleth provides\nsupport in favour of the administrative and technical feasibility of instituting such a\nsystem, much on lines of the arguments made by Nitin Bassi in this book. He cites\nevidence in the form of different kinds of water rights systems functioning in the\ncountry, while emphasizing the absolute necessity of formalizing such a system in\nthe interest of equity, efficiency and sustainability, especially in a context where\nexpansion of water supply faces major economic, financial and technological constraints. He cites evidence in the form of various systems of water rights functioning\nunder different socio-technical regimes in the country, and suggests that their existence \u2013 often for decades and centuries \u2013 is evidence that a water rights system is\nconsistent with what may be called an Indian water ethos. It seems then the core\nissue with regard to the functioning of a water rights system may be understanding\nthe relationship between water rights systems that already exist on the ground and\nhow they may articulate with a new water rights system that may be imposed\nthrough conscious policy intervention.\nV Ratna Reddy\u2019s analysis of the potential of different regulatory instruments and\ndemand management of water (Chap. 10) suggests the limitations of the commonly\nused instruments like pricing, supply regulation, direct and indirect policy regulation. He argues that these regulations have had a limited impact on account of the\ncomplex socioeconomic and resource systems, but also because of a lack of synergy\n\n \n6\n\nV.

While community based approaches to regulate the use of groundwater have had some positive effect, they have remained little more than pilots in the\nabsence of policy support or an enabling environment to scale them up.\n\n1.1.2\n\nGender and Integrated Water Resource Management\nin India\n\nIWRM (Integrated Water Resource Management) emerged as a new paradigm challenging the technocratic focus of water management over the previous decades.\nIWRM emphasizes integration across uses, sectors and disciplines while taking\ncognizance of gender and equity concerns (Mollinga et al. 2006). The major critique\naround IWRM has been the lack of political edge in the way it has been conceptualised and implemented (Kulkarni 2014). An overemphasis on River Basin organizations and formal organization structures without an understanding of the local\ninstitutional context in which the paradigm of IWRM is to be implemented are\nknown to have severely limited the relevance of the paradigm to the South Asian\ncontext (Mollinga et al. 2006).\nTushaar Shah and Barbara van Koppen, critically analysing the relevance of the\nparadigm to Indian contexts (Chap. 2), note that IWRM, in its present form, presents itself as a package of interventions of a \u2018\u2019one size fits all\u2019 nature around demand\nside management; the \u2018copybook\u2019 nature of IWRM reforms has been shaped by the\nglobal water discourse driven by international organizations. In developing countries in which these reforms have been experimented with, there was little effort to\ntailor the reform packages to local contexts. Hence, these reforms failed to address\nthe pressing water management challenges that these countries were confronted\nwith. The IWRM package, further, offers no guidance on what to do with the plethora of water institutions in the country. These reforms, they further note, also do not\nrespond to the priorities of the poor in developing countries.\nThe current paradigm of IWRM, advocating direct demand management, is\ntherefore at odds with the informal nature of water economies characterizing India\nand other countries at early stages of their development paths. The transformation\nof an informal water economy into a formal one, further, takes place through a long\nprocess of economic growth. Urbanization and occupational diversification are key\nprocesses characterising this transition. However, Shah and van Koppen suggest\nthat the IWRM package may still be relevant to formal and urban sectors of India\u2019s\nwater economy.\nGender mainstreaming has been an important component of the global discourse\non IWRM. Gender, referring to the socially defined roles of what it constitutes to be\n\n \n1\n\nIntroduction: Towards a Discursive Analysis of Indian Water Policy\n\n7\n\nmale or female, is a social construction whose meaning is contested and negotiated\n(Zwarteveen 2013). Gender mainstreaming in water has been understood to be a\nslow and difficult process (Kulkarni 2014; Joshi 2014; Ahmed 2008). Changes in\npolicy approaches to water management are known to have made little dent on the\nperverse niches created by the intersection of caste, class, gender and race in which\nwomen often find themselves (Joshi 2014). In her analysis of water and gender relations in this book, Seema Kulkarni (Chap. 5) traces the evolution of the gender\ndiscourse in the international water and development agenda and looks at the changing trajectory of policy efforts at mainstreaming gender in India. She argues that the\nrhetoric of gender would remain little more than a rhetoric unless it is located historically and understood as a set of complex relations between the different genders,\ndefined identities and embedded in hegemonic power relations cutting across caste,\nclass and race that serve the interests of state, capital and patriarchy. She notes that\nwhile in many cases the creation of formal spaces for women to participate and\ninfluence decision-making in water management has facilitated their empowerment,\nvery often the creation of such formal spaces has made little difference, as women\ncontinue to be entrenched in unique niches created by the intersection of caste, class\nand race.\nAhmed (2008) rightly notes that it may not be possible to link all water resource\nplanning in one national or country level IWRM strategy as proposed by advocates\nof IWRM. IWRM may indeed seem rational for some countries in Africa or Europe\nto develop; there is too much diversity and the need for context specific approaches\nis critical for a nation like India.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91cfe71-84ab-4b0f-aa1a-7166c3da9ac5": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91cfe71-84ab-4b0f-aa1a-7166c3da9ac5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2320e08-1dac-4228-b578-3ed1718d4c89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6bbce62a2733d83c137f23f3212635e43a2a906c89da26a282b81714deeeb95"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fb09a47-36fd-453d-85ed-04eb3d1c31fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8e9392fa8f45765c30a33c3b08d99b63e1a87609d6a0bcba576b6ea99fc1f78"}}, "hash": "3c9da70019f53eb1e5a445b87adc040e6ab466baef777b171058a37766be4d74", "text": "However, IWRM does provide a lens to look at\nwater resources holistically (Ahmed 2008; Shah and Prakash 2014). Gender analysis provides one of the means to do so. It is necessary however, more broadly to\nunderstand how water intersects with and transforms gender relations at different\ninstitutional levels or social contexts (Ahmed 2008; Kulkarni 2014; Joshi 2014).\n\n1.1.3\n\nExpanding Access to Clean Water and Sanitation\n\nAidan Cronin, Anjal Prakash, Praveen Sridhar and Sue Coates (Chap. 4) review the\nprogress made in India in the expansion of access to safe water supply and sanitation. They challenge the notion of water scarcity being a predominantly physical\nphenomenon and emphasize instead the role of institutional factors in shaping water\nscarcity, much on the lines of Mehta (2005). Though there are important positive\nrecommendations towards expanding the access to water in the 12th Five Year plan,\npolitical will and systematic implementation of the proposed reforms, they argue,\nwill be necessary. Recent policy efforts emphasize decentralization; however, on\naccount of paucity of resources and poor devolution of powers to the lower levels,\nlocal bodies remain limited in their ability to manage effectively. Though policy\ninitiatives have sought to create a wide variety of institutions at the local level, many\nof them are not accountable at the community level. Thus, decentralization poses\nnew challenges for power and accountability in local governance.\n\n \n8\n\nV. Narain\n\nPrakash Nelliyat (Chap. 8) undertakes a comprehensive review of the challenges\nof water pollution in India and observes that water pollution has not been a major\ntopic of political debate yet, and therefore, political instruments have been scarcely\nimplemented. Emission-based standards have not been very effective so far, since\nthey are rarely monitored and only occasionally enforced. He also argues that it may\nbe incorrect to adopt western water quality objectives that are inappropriate to the\nlevel of development and economic state of the adopting country. Though India has\nattempted to solve the water pollution issues through legislative and policy measures with huge budgets over a period of time, significant progress has not been\nachieved in this direction. He advocates an overhaul of the policy approach to combating the problem of water pollution, using a mix of strategies such as policy advocacy, governance and enforcement, stakeholders\u2019 Initiatives and capacity building,\nthe use of economic instruments and better coordination among line departments.\n\n1.1.4\n\nTechnological Solutions and the Inter-linking of Rivers\n\nPerhaps no subject has received as much critical attention, or been the subject of so\nmuch debate in the context of India\u2019s water governance as the proposal for the linking up of our major rivers. At the heart of these proposals has been the narrative that\nthe transfer of water from India\u2019s water surplus basins to her deficit basins provides\nthe key solution to her water problems. The debate on these proposals has been\ncharacterized by polarized views among their proponents and opponents. On the\none hand has been the technocracy that seems to propagate the narrative that the\nsolution to India\u2019s water woes lies in large-scale engineering solutions. This narrative has been challenged by the opponents of large-scale engineering solutions on\ngrounds of the high social, ecological and environmental costs of such projects. On\nthe one hand, the river-linking project in India has been criticised for the reductionist foundations of the paradigm that seeks to assert man\u2019s prerogative to control\nwater (D\u2019Souza 2002, 2003). On the other hand, it has been criticised for its failure\nto consider the systemic nature of the relationships between water, habitat, society\nand biodiversity (Bandopadhyay and Parveen 2004). This has created space for a\nbalanced and informed debate on the subject.\nIn this backdrop, Upali Amerasinghe and Tushaar Shah (Chap. 7) take a critical\nlook at this contentious proposal. They draw on a wide range of studies to assess the\nvalidity of various claims made with regard to the social, economic, hydrological\nand environmental facets of these transfers. They conclude that not withstanding the\nstrong judicial attention that the proposal has received, the idea of a National River\nLinking Project may have come a decade or two too soon; the underlying assumptions behind the proposal for the inter-linking of rivers have changed since when the\nproposal was first conceptualized. The project, they conclude, is too large to conduct a holistic analysis leading to a complete assessment of its costs and benefits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fb09a47-36fd-453d-85ed-04eb3d1c31fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fb09a47-36fd-453d-85ed-04eb3d1c31fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d91cfe71-84ab-4b0f-aa1a-7166c3da9ac5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c9da70019f53eb1e5a445b87adc040e6ab466baef777b171058a37766be4d74"}, "3": {"node_id": "b884d9b3-a227-44f9-956c-f4a2479c57e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e5f95baa6ca03fdcf1f2a5f956b6d9b7cd8efded1542cbc30419bfc16c9bd89"}}, "hash": "b8e9392fa8f45765c30a33c3b08d99b63e1a87609d6a0bcba576b6ea99fc1f78", "text": "There is too little data available in the public domain.

While the\nefficiency gains from the adoption of micro-irrigation are substantial, further\nresearch is needed to examine the social and institutional conditions that will facilitate the adoption of these technologies in Indian contexts as well as the social profile\nof the users of these technologies.\n\n1.1.5\n\nIndependent Regulatory Authorities: Balancing\nAutonomy and Control\n\nThe subject of Independent Regulatory Authorities (IRAs) has generated much\ndebate in India, especially with regard to questions of regulation and autonomy in\nthe water sector (Warghade and Wagle 2014; Rao and Badiger 2014). Sachin\nWarghade (Chap. 6) examines critically the evolution of IRAs in the country. The\nfunctioning of IRAs raises important questions regarding both accountability and\nautonomy in the water sector; however, Warghade raises more basic questions\nregarding their appropriateness to Indian settings. He proposes that a decentered\napproach, with a strong knowledge component and backed by a pro-people normative framework may lead to a more effective and comprehensive framework for\nwater regulation in India.\n\n1.2\n\nIndian Water Policy and Governance Research\nfor the Future\n\nAs noted earlier in this chapter, South Asian Water Resources scholarship has experienced an upsurge in recent years; given the present pattern of societal developments, water problems will become more severe in the years ahead (Mollinga 2008).\nIn this context, a call is made for a pluralistic and integrated framework for formulating and implementing water policies in South Asia (Prakash et al. 2013). A case\nis made to listen to the multiple voices that are emerging in understanding water; it\nis argued that it is necessary to create space for dialogue among civil society and\ncitizens (Lahiri-Dutt 2008). This is necessary particularly in the wake of a greater\nrole for actors other than the state, notably civil society, in influencing water policy,\nboth in terms of content as well as the processes of policy formulation (Narayanan\net al. 2014; Narain et al. 2014).\nThe chapters in this book suggest that the dominant modes of water policy analysis in the country have witnessed a change. This is perhaps in the wake of a call for\n\n \n10\n\nV. Narain\n\nmore reflective thinking on the types and modes of critique in light of a persistent\ndeadlock in transforming dominant approaches to water resources development and\nmanagement (Mollinga 2008). As noted earlier in this chapter, water scholars are\nincreasingly turning their attention to the relationships between the hydrological,\ntechnological, economic and social dimensions of water management; rather than\nseeing them in isolation. Issues of gender and equity are gaining prominence in\ndiscourses on water management, breaking conventional polarizations that have\ncharacterised the debate and discourses on the subject.\nWithin the broad realm of policy studies, the contributions in this book, speak to\nthe prescriptive dimensions of water policy.5 Further research should unpack more\nexplicitly the process dimensions of water policy in India, focusing on a discursive\nanalysis of public policy. There is increasing recognition of the processes of contestation in water policy formulation and implementation (Saravanan and Ip 2013).\nFurther research should capture the role of competing narratives and discourses on\nthe framing of water policies, as well as the role of different interest groups in\npropagating and perpetuating these. The analysis of the \u2018ethnographies of the state\u2019,\nfor instance, provides one entry point (Sangameswaran 2013).\nThere is growing recognition of increasing stress on water resources. Several\nwritings in the Indian water literature, including some contributions in this book,\npaint a \u2018scare scenario\u2019 with regard to the country\u2019s water future. An important\nimplication of the on-going process of democratization of water governance in the\ncountry, however is that coupled with the multiplication of stresses on water, this\nwill create a more visible demand for platforms for negotiation, conflict resolution\nand dialogue across different categories of users and uses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b884d9b3-a227-44f9-956c-f4a2479c57e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b884d9b3-a227-44f9-956c-f4a2479c57e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fb09a47-36fd-453d-85ed-04eb3d1c31fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8e9392fa8f45765c30a33c3b08d99b63e1a87609d6a0bcba576b6ea99fc1f78"}, "3": {"node_id": "20ce4b43-fcba-42f1-b4f7-fe3c82b6f090", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91f265b7e78ef6c4ef60751383a1a8648615be90365eec106c5cd45455060611"}}, "hash": "3e5f95baa6ca03fdcf1f2a5f956b6d9b7cd8efded1542cbc30419bfc16c9bd89", "text": "This could happen at\nvarious levels: rural-urban/periurban, regional and transboundary.

The trouble with the \u2018IWRM package\u2019, and indeed the global water\ngovernance debate as a whole, is its intent to transform, all at once, a predominantly\ninformal water economy into a predominantly formal one\u2014something that would\nnormally be the result of a long process of economic growth and the transformation\nthat comes in its wake. In the IWRM discourse, formalizing informal water economies is improving water governance. But evidence across the world suggests that\nthere is no shortcut for a poor society to morph its informal water economy into a\nformal one; the process by which this happens is organically tied to wider processes\nof economic growth.

Shah and B. van Koppen\n\nabsolute water scarcity (Seckler et al. 1999; Cosgrove 2003; Cosgrove and Rijsberman\n2000; Rosegrant et al. 2002). The intensification of water scarcity is expected to play\nout in myriad different ways with variegated consequences. A major consequence\nwill be the deepening of \u2018water poverty\u2019, a phrase used to indicate difficulty people\nface in securing adequate and reliable access to water for productive and consumptive uses. A related concern is also the deterioration of water environment, reflected\nin drying up of wetlands, deterioration in water quality, desertification.\nGlobal discussions over the past decade have resulted in a variety of viewpoints\nabout how best developing countries can cope with this imminent condition. At one\nextreme, researchers suggest that crying need is for honing even more than in the\npast the social capacity of communities and societies to adapt to water scarcity\n(Ohlsson and Turton 1999; Wolfe and Brooks 2003). However, a more widely\nshared view is the urgent need to make a transition from water resource development mode\u2014in which countries like India have been steeped since 1830s when\nArthur Cotton rebuilt the grand anicut on Cauvery\u2014to water resource management\nmode by embracing Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).\nAt one level, IWRM is a philosophy. Global Water Partnership (2000) for\ninstance defines it as \u201ca process which promotes coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximize the resultant\neconomic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems\u201d. This is hard to find fault with. However, at an operational level, IWRM even though fuzzy (Biswas 2004), is centrally about integrated\nand direct management of sectoral and aggregate water demand, something which\nis absent in most developing countries. As distinct from the supply-side focus of\npublic policy action in water sector\u2014of governments as well as donors\u2014on \u2018developing\u2019 the resource by investing in infrastructure, IWRM discussions emphasize the\nneed to embrace demand-side management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91f2b3e-cedc-4e76-a481-7cbbc7cb5f57": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91f2b3e-cedc-4e76-a481-7cbbc7cb5f57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b25ed87b-9ea3-4512-a523-3f741f969fc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38223b1b58e216530d46fdbe2b98120c190bb374d7aa8ed63769d8395fac34e3"}, "3": {"node_id": "43a9677a-f72b-4757-9152-5e6425ff2990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d7dbe6bc114e738f090354dfeae2136910629f3db03014743d689a5d0043104"}}, "hash": "2bdb34e65f1e8d834387f628cfcce9adf01d2b4d2954139dd370a2d80129f486", "text": "In many low-income Asian and African\ncountries where it has been aggressively promoted by international agencies in\nrecent years, the \u2018IWRM package\u2019 has basically included a clutch of following\ninstruments:\n\u2022 A National Water Policy so that there is a cohesive, well-understood normative\nframework to guide all players in the sector.\n\u2022 A water law and regulatory framework for coordinated action for sustainable\nwater resources management;\n\u2022 Recognition of the River basin as the unit of water and land resources planning and management and creation of River Basin Organizations in place of\nterritorial/functional departments;\n\u2022 Treating water as an economic good by pricing water resource as well as services, especially outside life-line uses, to reflect its scarcity value so that it is\nefficiently used and allocated to high value uses;\n\u2022 Creation of water rights, preferably tradable, by instituting a system of water\nwithdrawal permits;\n\u2022 Participatory Water Resource Management with involvement of women so that\n\u2018water becomes everybody\u2019s business\u2019.\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n17\n\nIn dozens of developing countries, adopting IWRM has essentially meant implementing variations of the above package. India\u2019s various enunciations of National\nWater Policy, including the latest in 2012 (Government of India 2012) have sworn\nby several of these principles. In Sri Lanka, for instance, the 2001 draft water policy\nand water law provided for establishing state ownership of all water, the institution\nof water use rights through withdrawal permits, pricing of water in all uses, transferable water permits to encourage trade in water rights, replacement of existing water\norganizations by river basin organizations (Samad 2005). Embracing the above, it is\nimplied in the IWRM discourse, will help alleviate water poverty by improving\naccess to water and minimizing environmental ill-effects associated with current\npatterns of water resources development in developing countries like India\n(Lawrence et al. 2003). Among several things, IWRM involves working to improve\nthe potency and effectiveness of three pillars of the water institutional framework:\nwater policies, water laws and water administration in managing the water affairs of\na society through a new emphasis on direct water demand management (see, e.g.\nBandaragoda and Firdousi 1992; Merrey 1996; Frederiksen and Vissia 1998;\nHolmes 2000; Saleth 2004; Saleth and Dinar 2004).\nThis new class of concerns has put on the backburner an earlier class of yet-to-beresolved concerns about the limitations of \u2018supply side initiatives\u2019 with which India\nand many other developing countries struggled during the 1970s through the early\n1990s. These had to do centrally with the need for and the efficiency of appropriate\nwater infrastructure and services, promoting their financial and social sustainability,\nimproving the performance of irrigation, and water supply and sanitation projects\nalong several dimensions and at multiple levels: techno-economic efficiency; cost\nrecovery; spatial and social equity in access to project benefits; investment in operation and maintenance, and so on. There were major issues of institutional reforms in\npublic irrigation projects as well as rural and urban water supply and sanitation projects with emphasis shifting back and forth between reforming the bureaucracy to\nuser-participatory management to public-private partnerships. In these discussions,\nthe focus of analysis and action was squarely at the level of the user, community or a\nproject; and the concerns of researchers and practitioners were about techno-economic efficiency, equity, socio-economic and environmental sustainability of infrastructure investments. Even before these issues have begun to get resolved, the\nIWRM paradigm has begun to shift the locus of policy discussions from improving\nwater infrastructure and services at community and project levels to improving the\nmanagement of water resources at the level of river basins.\n\n2.2\n\nWater Poverty: Is It Caused by Water Scarcity?\n\nA critical implicit assumption underlying the IWRM discourse is that water poverty\u2014reflecting lack of access to water for productive and consumptive needs for\ncommunities\u2014is a result of the water scarcity and the failure of water institutions\nand policies to counter it. If this is indeed the case, then, embracing IWRM can be\na big answer to water poverty of nations. But is this really the case?\n\n \n18\n\nT. Shah and B. van Koppen\n\nThe Water Poverty Index (WPI) covering 147 countries published by researchers\nfrom Keele University and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingford, UK in\n2003 provides a readymade global data base to explore the relationship between\nwater poverty and water scarcity (Lawrence et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43a9677a-f72b-4757-9152-5e6425ff2990": {"__data__": {"id_": "43a9677a-f72b-4757-9152-5e6425ff2990", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d91f2b3e-cedc-4e76-a481-7cbbc7cb5f57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bdb34e65f1e8d834387f628cfcce9adf01d2b4d2954139dd370a2d80129f486"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e38bd9b-8641-4fa2-8829-611565d3a688", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc0a3f2c817bab11572b4bac27d3efd616344a657b1d2b6645b9aaac502f31c6"}}, "hash": "8d7dbe6bc114e738f090354dfeae2136910629f3db03014743d689a5d0043104", "text": "2003; Sullivan and Meigh 2003).1\nTable 2.1 below summarizes the results of multiple regression results that underpin\nour discussions in the above paragraphs.

The index was constructed by combining five component indices that cover water resource endowments, access to water, human\ncapacity, water use efficiency, and quality of water environment. Each of the five component indices was given equal weight to generate the Water Poverty Index that takes values in the range of 0\nand 100, the higher the value, lower the water poverty.\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n19\n\nLike the global discussions, the authors of WPI too subscribe to the \u2018waterscarcity-determining-water-poverty\u2019 hypothesis when they say their aim was to\n\u2018express an interdisciplinary measure which \u2026 indicates the degree to which water\nscarcity impacts on human populations\u2019 (Lawrence et al. 2003). But is this hypothesis borne out by global database painstakingly compiled by the WPI authors themselves? A regression of WPI run on water resources per capita of the 147 countries\nsuggests no direct relationship between the two. It might be argued that the real\nindicator of water poverty is \u201cWater Access Poverty (WAP)\u201d sub-component of the\nWPI suggestive of the levels of \u2018water welfare\u2019 achieved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e38bd9b-8641-4fa2-8829-611565d3a688": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e38bd9b-8641-4fa2-8829-611565d3a688", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "43a9677a-f72b-4757-9152-5e6425ff2990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d7dbe6bc114e738f090354dfeae2136910629f3db03014743d689a5d0043104"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2111537-5489-4a3a-8210-ce47f768f8eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c823ef418c9a10b980a8403537fee214cec10bf20f66e211888514fc515ac89e"}}, "hash": "cc0a3f2c817bab11572b4bac27d3efd616344a657b1d2b6645b9aaac502f31c6", "text": "However, the correlation\nbetween WAP index and water resource endowments too was found to be low. For\nnearly every level of per capita water resource endowments, we find countries which\nare at the bottom as well as top of the WAP index. A least-square line fitted to WAP\nindex and per capita water resource endowment of countries turns out to be virtually\nflat, suggesting no relationship of quantitative significance between water endowments of nations and the water welfare of their citizens. Laos, Nicaragua, Cambodia,\nBangladesh, Sierra Leon have much higher per capita water endowments compared\nto Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UK and Mauritius; yet the former are far more \u2018Water\nAccess Poor\u2019 than the latter.\nThese analyses show that while water availability has only a weak relationship\nwith overall socio-economic development, WAP index is strongly related to the\nHDI. The higher the HDI of a country, lower the water poverty, regardless of a\ncountry\u2019s water endowments. Our analyses support an even bolder hypothesis that\nWAP is strongly and positively related to per capita GDP (adjusted for ppp) (see\nregression 4 Table 2.1).\nIn exploring the relationship between the quality of environment and levels of\neconomic development, researchers have already postulated and tested the\n\u2018Environmental Kuznet\u2019s Curve\u2019 which would suggest that as countries begin from\nlow levels of economic development, the quality of their environment first declines\nas intensive economic growth uses natural resources as \u2018factors of production\u2019\n(Bhattarai and Hammig 2001). However, as levels of living improve, growing\ndemand for \u2018environmental amenity\u2019 generates pressures to seek avenues for economic growth that are light in the demands they make on scarce natural resources\u2014\nwhat Gleick (2002) calls \u2018soft water path\u2019. If this were true, an index of environmental\nquality would show an inverted U relationship with levels of economic growth. Our\nanalyses based on data from 147 countries supports this inverted U relationship in\nregression 6 in Table 2.1 (note: the higher the value of the index, lower the quality\nof water environment). It suggests that as levels of material well-being improve for\na majority of a country\u2019s people, need for clean water environment becomes a concern for the majority rather than just the environment groups, governments and\ninternational donors.\nIn regressions 1 and 2, besides HDI and GDP respectively, water resource endowment is statistically significant and has a large standardized B-coefficient, likely because\nwater resource endowment is a component of WPI. In regressions 3 and 4, where\nWAP\u2014the true measure of water welfare of a country\u2014is the dependent variable, however, water resource endowment variable turns insignificant and its standardized\n\n \n20\n\nT. Shah and B. van Koppen\n\nB-coefficients are very small, too. These suggest that water resource endowments have\nno relationship with the water poverty of nations. In these regressions, HDI and GDP per\ncapita emerge as the key determinants of WAP with large t-ratios as well as standardized\nB-coefficients. Regression 5 suggests resource availability as well as GDP are significant determinants of water environment; but the overall fit of this regression improves\ngreatly (as suggested by the increase in R2 in regression 6 when the squared value of\nGDP is added; it emerges as highly significant, turns GDP co-efficient into a negative\nvalue thus suggesting better fit for a U-shaped relationship).\n\n2.3\n\nIWRM in an Informal Water Economy\n\nThere is a need to unpack this apparently neat relationship between water poverty\nand overall economic growth. Many people find it hard to accept these results\nbecause it apparently leads them to conclude that low-income countries like India\nhave little or no scope to improve their water resources management; and that economic growth is the only path for them to reduce their water poverty. A more logical\nconclusion to draw from this analysis is that, in order to be effective, water resource\nmanagement strategies of nations have to be context-specific; and the defining\naspect of the context that matters is the position of a country in the evolutionary\nprocess of economic development rather than its water resource endowment (see\nalso, World Bank 2005). This analysis raises questions about the usefulness of the\none-size-fits-all frameworks\u2014such as the IWRM paradigm\u2014that dominate global\ndiscussions about how developing countries can put their water sectors in order.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2111537-5489-4a3a-8210-ce47f768f8eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2111537-5489-4a3a-8210-ce47f768f8eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e38bd9b-8641-4fa2-8829-611565d3a688", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc0a3f2c817bab11572b4bac27d3efd616344a657b1d2b6645b9aaac502f31c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "5116dc1a-3cc3-47e9-9db9-3ff8a26321eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9742ef10c4edd4b7e8b75847afa0ab9c70ab7e7e3a5fdeb91710d11e09a3eda"}}, "hash": "c823ef418c9a10b980a8403537fee214cec10bf20f66e211888514fc515ac89e", "text": "Use\nof economic pricing and withdrawal permits to encourage efficient allocation and\nuse of water, transforming irrigation bureaucracies into river basin organizations for\nIntegrated River Basin Management, enforcing laws to regulate groundwater pumping and controlling non-point pollution of aquifers are some of the stock policy\nreforms that are commonly recommended because these help orderly functioning of\nwater economies in industrialized countries; however, evidence is mounting that\nmany of these reforms are unimplementable in developing countries.\nThe constraint developing countries run into in implementing these arises from\nthe highly informal nature of their water economies; and this has nothing to do with\ntheir water scarcity or abundance but has everything to do with their being at early\nstages of overall economic development. By definition, an informal economy is that\npart of the economy that remains outside formal mechanisms of governance\u2014law,\npolicy and administration (Fiege 1990). Incorporation of informal economies into\nwhat economic historian Douglass North (1990) called the \u2018modern transactions\nsector\u2019 occurs gradually as part of overall processes of economic growth. Until substantial proportion of a sectoral economy gets formalized, it would be well nigh\nimpossible to bring it meaningfully within the ambit of formal structures of direct\ngovernance. In the context of developing countries like India, paradigms like\nIWRM\u2014advocating direct demand management\u2014are then fundamentally at odds\nwith the highly informal nature of their water economies.\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n21\n\nTake the case of India. Government documents claim that protected water supply2 covers 95 % of the country\u2019s rural habitations. Yet a large nation-wide survey\nin 1998 that reached out to some 130,000 rural and urban households showed a different picture (NSSO 1999a: report 449) showed that nearly 80 % of India\u2019s rural\nhouseholds surveyed self-supplied their domestic water requirements\u2014from\ndomestic or irrigation wells, tanks, ponds, streams, etc\u2014and were not in contact\nwith any service provider or public or community agency in the formal sector. For\nurban households, the opposite held with over 75 % of the households \u2018connected\u2019\u2014\nwhich suggests that as India urbanizes, growing proportions of its population would\ncome into contact with formal water service providers. Comparing the data across\nstates suggests that in poorer states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, all or most rural\nhouseholds self-supply their domestic water, where as in somewhat better-off states\nsuch as Haryana, Punjab and Goa, domestic water supply gets increasingly \u2018formalized\u2019, suggesting that even rural households begin getting connected to some public\nwater supply system as village economies grow, regardless of water resource\nendowments. Studies in six Indian cities during 2003 showed that economically\nstrong households were much more likely to be connected to public water supply\nsystems and poorer ones either self-supply or rely on informal sector service providers (Londhe et al. 2004).\nThe picture with irrigation is no different. Many researchers have shown that\nalthough under the control of government bureaucracies, at the grassroots levels,\nIndia\u2019s canal systems are barely functioning anarchies, with informal institutional\narrangements ruling the roost. Even if we assume that farmers served with irrigation\nby canals are in some sense connected to the \u2018formal water economy\u2019, the National\nSample Survey of 2002 (NSSO 2003) of 4646 villages throughout India showed\nthat government canals have increasingly lost out in relative share of irrigators: over\n80 % of sample villages used irrigation mostly from wells but also from tanks, and\nstreams without being connected with, or under direct administrative influence of,\neither the irrigation bureaucracy or any other formal agency. This is village-level\ndata; but much other evidence can be adduced from household level surveys in support of the fact that there is a great deal more irrigation going on in India than is\nacknowledged; and over 4/5th of this is in the informal sector. Similar impression\nemerges about the ownership and management of village water infrastructure. The\nNSS 54th round of survey (NSSO 1999b, report 452: 46) in 1998 of 78,990 rural\nhouseholds in 5110 villages throughout India suggests that 90 % of water infrastructural assets used by survey households were self-managed (and owned) by households; only around 10 % were owned and/or managed by government or local\ncommunity organizations.\nThis predominantly informal nature of India\u2019s water economy raises questions\nabout the reach of the \u2018three pillars\u2019 of water governance: water policy, law and administration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5116dc1a-3cc3-47e9-9db9-3ff8a26321eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5116dc1a-3cc3-47e9-9db9-3ff8a26321eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2111537-5489-4a3a-8210-ce47f768f8eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c823ef418c9a10b980a8403537fee214cec10bf20f66e211888514fc515ac89e"}, "3": {"node_id": "f04fdb90-ceaa-4596-b7fb-fe743536086e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c0dab8587f8d130095a47e39cbdf67fa4776f83d02407ddce53ffa609bedf5a"}}, "hash": "e9742ef10c4edd4b7e8b75847afa0ab9c70ab7e7e3a5fdeb91710d11e09a3eda", "text": "It also raises questions not so much about the need for but about the practicality of implementing water pricing, basin level water allocation, and water legislation in\n2\n\nWhich presumably means water supply through a local community-based or municipal body that\ntakes some responsibility of quality.\n\n \n22\n\nT.

During the past decade, the\ngovernment of Sri Lanka has made two bold but abortive attempts to push through\naggressive IWRM-style reforms in the water sector. The latest draft water policy\nand water law provided for: (a) establishing state ownership of all water, (b) institution of water use rights through withdrawal permits, (c) pricing of water in all uses,\n(d) transferable water permits to encourage trade in water rights, (e) replacement of\nexisting water organizations by river basin organizations\u2014in sum, copybook IWRM\nreforms. The media and civil society however took to the turf bitterly opposing the\nvery logic underlying the proposed reforms (Samad 2005). The government withdrew the reforms in a hurry; however, little thought was given to how exactly would\ntheir provisions be implemented had the new water policy and law got passed.\nMany South East Asian countries\u2014notably, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam\u2014\nhowever, faced no such opposition from media and civil society and swiftly passed\nwater laws that incorporated key IWRM instruments including formation of river\nbasin organizations, registration of water users and issue of withdrawal permits as a\nmechanism for creating tradable water rights, participatory management of irrigation systems through service contracts between agencies and users, and so on (Molle\n2005). Molle, however, found little match between the reality of the water economies of these countries and the reforms borne out of \u2018a global water discourse\nlargely driven by international organizations\u2019. His review of the experience with\nIWRM in Mekong led him to emphasize \u201ca gap between formal and state-centered\ninitiatives and reality on the ground, which proceeds at a different pace. Lessons\nlearned elsewhere are certainly important but cannot be adopted indiscriminately\nand must not be allowed to crowd out the emergence of endogenous and conditionspecific solutions.\u201d In brief, IWRM came unstuck.\nA similar feeling was echoed in a 2005 African Water Law workshop about\ndonor-induced IWRM style water policy reforms in many African countries (see\nShah and van Koppen 2005). With the onset of the 1990s, many African countries\ntook to IWRM wholesale. Almost everywhere, thinking about improving the\nfunctioning of the water economy involved little effort to fit policy reforms to the\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n23\n\nlocal reality. Almost everywhere, water reforms: (a) declared water as state property, (b) instituted water withdrawal permits, (c) made water pricing mandatory for\nall but domestic uses, and (d) led to the formation of river basin organizations with\nwater allocation mandate in water economies where the bulk of the water diverted\nis (and most of the water users are) in the informal sector with little or no direct\ncontact with formal water agencies.\nInstitutional reforms take a long time to sink and produce desired impacts; in\nAfrica, however, evidence is already piling to suggest that IWRM reforms seem to\nhave done little to improve anything; instead, they created undue tension, hassle and\nin extreme cases, dispossession of the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f04fdb90-ceaa-4596-b7fb-fe743536086e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f04fdb90-ceaa-4596-b7fb-fe743536086e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5116dc1a-3cc3-47e9-9db9-3ff8a26321eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9742ef10c4edd4b7e8b75847afa0ab9c70ab7e7e3a5fdeb91710d11e09a3eda"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ab987b1-fc17-4b60-812b-365bea95b140", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "61dbf28fd963d6a2a3216915d795f814a9408bc3798e58890306e9a5d8e1309d"}}, "hash": "6c0dab8587f8d130095a47e39cbdf67fa4776f83d02407ddce53ffa609bedf5a", "text": "In particular, the Workshop identified\nfour problems:\n(a) the aims that the water reforms seemed designed to achieve did not reflect the\ncurrent water sector priorities of the countries as viewed by national policy\nmakers, civil society and citizens;\n(b) reforms touched only a small formalized segment of the water economy and a\ntiny proportion of water use and users; as a result, their impacts on the water\nsector were neither deep nor broad;\n(c) however, they threatened disintegration of customary laws and institutions\nevolved and used by communities; these are never ideal, but they are timetested, robust and perform their basic functions well; and\n(d) they also created serious distortions, threatened dispossession of large numbers\nof poor, and created new vested interests; these potentially deleterious impacts\nwere limited only by the fact that almost everywhere reforms failed to stick,\nlaws remained largely unenforced, water prices remained uncollected.\nWhat, then, went wrong with Africa\u2019s and Mekong countries\u2019 water reforms?\nSeveral things, it seems. Many countries just copied laws made elsewhere, just as\nseveral states in India have blindly copied Andhra Pradesh\u2019s law on participatory\nirrigation management, and Pakistan Punjab has copied the water law of the state of\nColorado in the USA. In Africa too, countries did a \u2018copy and paste\u2019, for example,\nof parts of the South African National Water Act. Without consultation, public participation, and a serious attempt to fit reforms to the context, the impact of these\nreforms was bound to be negative if at all. And now, Ghana is having second\nthoughts on its reform strategy and going back to the drawing board.\nIn Africa, as in some Asian countries like Sri Lanka, international agencies and\nglobal thinking rather than analysis of local context and need has had a powerful\ninfluence on the design of water sector reforms. Tanzania is a case in point; its 1991\nwater policy identified water development and provision as a key national policy\ngoal and argued for more water storage creation. However, creating new storage and\ninfrastructure was anathema to international donors; so Tanzania ended up doing\nwhat donors would support: stock textbook IWRM, which included state ownership\nof water resources, water withdrawal permits, water tax, legal institutional reform,\nriver basin organizations, Water User Associations (WUAs), but no attempt to get\nwhat its people need most, more and better-managed infrastructure. Tanzanians all\nalong had plans to build storages but were secretive about it for the fear of donor\n\n \n24\n\nT. Shah and B. van Koppen\n\nreprimand. In implementing the first phase of the IWRM project, however, the leadership figured that reforms could not deliver what Tanzania\u2019s rural communities\nneed badly, i.e., better domestic water supply systems, improved irrigation water\ncontrol and better hydraulic infrastructure rather than water withdrawal permits,\nwater pricing and catchment organizations.\nThe only African country where water reforms have produced semblance of\nimproved governance of water resources is South Africa, which has emerged as a\nmodel, exemplifying IWRM type water sector reforms in an emerging economy\ncontext. South Africa is interesting because of its first-world-third-world duality. In\nterms of income inequality, South Africa is next only to Brazil. 54 % of South\nAfrica\u2019s water use is in agriculture; and 95 % of its farm lands are owned by a small\nminority of white commercial farmers. In the Olifants, one of South Africa\u2019s most\ndeveloped basins, 95 % of rural water resources is used by only 0.5 % of the population, white commercial farmers. The Gini coefficient for rural water use is as high\nas 0.96 (Cullis and Van Koppen 2005).\nSouth Africa\u2019s ground-breaking water law (chapter 4 of the Act: section 21)\nspecifies the following uses and brings them within its IWRM mandate: (a) taking\nwater from a water resource; (b) storing water; (c) engaging in a stream-flow reduction activity, such as forestry; (d) control activities. E.g., irrigating with wastewater;\n(e) discharging of wastewater into a water source through a pipe, canal, etc.\nAll those using water for the above purposes have to register, pay water use charge\nand a water resource management charge. South Africa has all of 62,000 authorized,\nbillable water users (or registered primary diverters) that account for 11 billion m3 of\nwater allocation for commercial agriculture, 5 billion m3 for industry and municipal\nuses, and 9 billion m3 for forestry.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ab987b1-fc17-4b60-812b-365bea95b140": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ab987b1-fc17-4b60-812b-365bea95b140", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "f04fdb90-ceaa-4596-b7fb-fe743536086e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c0dab8587f8d130095a47e39cbdf67fa4776f83d02407ddce53ffa609bedf5a"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd87f69f-535a-4340-a8b7-63e6d5937e84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5042f00d08e2da176c7300fca832bf91bd56f8cf9e10cc76c3e2061f7077b20a"}}, "hash": "61dbf28fd963d6a2a3216915d795f814a9408bc3798e58890306e9a5d8e1309d", "text": "The Government of South Africa generates around 2\nbillion rand/year (USD 0.35 billion/year) as income from water tariffs.

Many commercial farmers have extended their irrigated areas unlawfully, posing\nthat they are using their water allocation more efficiently. A critical issue for officials is\nwhether to rely on voluntary compliance or evolve a system of policing.\nInterestingly, however, the South African IWRM leaves 95 % of its people out of\nits ambit. All of 2.3 billion m3\u2014about 10 %\u2014of total water use is allocated to the\nso called schedule-1 users, mostly rural black South Africans, who include some 18\nmillion primary diverters of water for domestic use, irrigating tiny food plots and\nsmall vegetable gardens.

Formation of CMAs, turning over of small-holder irrigation systems to\nWUAs, promotion of appropriate technologies\u2014central to improving the lives of\nthe vast majority of South Africans\u2014remain major challenges that the country\u2019s\nwater reforms are yet to begin to meet. These are also the challenges facing India,\nBangladesh, Nepal and numerous poor countries. IWRM is working in European\nSouth Africa, but the African South Africa has to begin at the beginning.\nThe lesson India needs to learn from the experience of all these countries is centrally about the gap between the precept and practice of IWRM. There can be little\nquestioning the basic IWRM premises such as that water should be priced to reflect\nits scarcity value, that it is best managed at basin level, that reform of property rights\nwill promote its efficient and sustainable use. The question is how to make these\nstick in water economies that are predominantly informal. All the evidence we have\nsuggests that these work best where:\n(a) primary water diverters are large, body corporates and few in number;\n(b) most water users are supplied by organized service providers; and\n(c) capital accumulation in terms of infrastructure creation is already high.\nIn contrast, IWRM-style demand management reforms would fail to stick where:\n(a) most of the country\u2019s households are primary water diverters; (b) most selfsupply their water requirements directly from a natural source; and (c) capital accumulation in water infrastructure is very low.\nAll in all, the IWRM paradigm neither responds to the priorities of the poor in\npoor countries, nor does it resonate with their ground conditions which make implementing water pricing, reform of property rights, allocating water at basin level\nwork. The key factor often ignored is the number of primary diverters of water from\nnature. In rich countries, these are often just a very small number of body corporates\u2014water companies, utilities, municipalities, co-operatives\u2014who serve the\nwater needs of all users that are no longer primary diverters.

At US$468, per capita water bill the Swiss pay annually is higher than the\nper capita total income of Bangladesh. All its water users are served by a network\nof municipal, corporate, co-operative water service providers. It has stringent laws\nand regulations about water abstraction from any water body which can be done\nonly through formal concessions. However, these concessions are held only by a\nsmall number of formal service providing public agencies; as a result, their enforcement entails little transaction costs.

Regardless of its water endowments, as a\nlow-income economy climbs up the economic ladder, the organization of its water\neconomy undergoes a transformation in tandem with the transformation of the society as a whole. The foremost driver of this transformation is urbanization and occupational diversification. As the proportion of rural and agrarian population declines,\nagricultural water demand eases. With urbanization and economic growth, selfprovision of water is increasingly replaced by service providers. In poor economies,\nimplicit costs of water acquisition\u2014in the form of labor spent in fetching water\u2014\nare high, especially for the poor; with economic growth, labor costs decline but\nmonetary cost of buying water service increases. In affluent countries, scientific and\neconomic resources devoted by the society per km3 of water diverted are much\nhigher than in poorer countries.\n3\n\nScott Roselle used this phrase recently to refer to the unexceptionable tendency of agricultural\npopulation ratios of countries to fall as their economies grow. But I think this also applies to other\nresponses to economic development as outlined in Fig. 2.1.\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n27\n\nFig. 2.1 Transformation of informal water economies in response to overall economic growth\n\nAlong with these changes, water institutions too undergo profound change. In very\npoor societies, self-provision of water by households is ubiquitous; in much of Africa,\nwe do not find local, informal markets even for pump irrigation service that are widespread in South Asia. Countries at somewhat higher level of economic growth witness\nlimited local specialization in water services provision in an informal manner. As\neconomies grow still further, local specialization\u2014and informal institutions associated with these\u2014disappear as large, professionally run corporates take over the role\nof procurement, processing and retailing of water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc7ea2eb-eb78-4d3a-99f7-ee6fe64e8b42": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc7ea2eb-eb78-4d3a-99f7-ee6fe64e8b42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd87f69f-535a-4340-a8b7-63e6d5937e84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5042f00d08e2da176c7300fca832bf91bd56f8cf9e10cc76c3e2061f7077b20a"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7bf77fe-13f7-4c53-964d-915c533e2046", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "100fbaf35ec3de5bc907214fa977ceae1995b289fbc2b19b11d458a6636cae60"}}, "hash": "51412ca44cdf58dad3feca245aa64f9af3949ecb6e4d80c9187fe212d045c0ef", "text": "Thus, the informal water institutions we find in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh\u2014such as, say, pump irrigation markets, urban tanker water markets\u2014are unlikely to be found in Australia or Spain\nbecause those countries have outlived the need for these by creating specialized water\ninstitutions at a higher level that their citizens need and can now afford. Likewise,\nwater institutions that are standard in industrialized countries\u2014high net-worth water\ncompanies managing a city\u2019s water supply system\u2014would not begin to work until\nDhaka as a water service market evolved, at least, to Manila\u2019s or Jakarta\u2019s level.4\n\n4\n\nIf accounts of the travails facing global water companies like Vivendi and Thames Water who are\nforced to wind up even in these increasingly affluent east- Asian cities is any guide, we must\n\n \n28\n\nT. Shah and B. van Koppen\n\nFor much the same reasons, it is difficult to find a country in say Sub-Saharan\nAfrica with a modern water industry of the kind we find in a European country.\nSouth Africa may be the exception that proves this rule: white South Africa\u2014inhabiting its towns or operating large, commercial farms in the countryside\u2014is served\nby what approximates a modern, formalized water sector. However, the former\nhomelands, where half of South Africans live, are served by a water economy even\nmore informal than India\u2019s.\nWe have so far discussed IWRM paradigm\u2019s errors of commission. However, its\nmajor error of omission is that it offers no guidance on what to do with a plethora of\nwater institutions that developing countries already have. The here-and-now challenge of water governance in low-income countries like India is one of understanding and working with groundswells of spontaneous institutional formations which\nhave emerged and sustained to create value for water users. Informal, decentralized\npump irrigation markets today serve 1/3rd of India\u2019s gross irrigated areas (Mukherji\n2005), as much as the share of all public irrigation projects. There is a booming\nculture fishery in the making in small common property ponds and tanks throughout\nIndia providing livelihoods and improving nutrition of millions of rural households.\nNew technologies and stocking material created the potential for a boom; however,\nit is the myriad changes that have occurred in the institutional arrangements for\nleasing of small water bodies that have energized this boom. Where state governments dogmatically adhered to the communitarian ideal, the boom has remained\nmuted; where they have adopted an entrepreneur-friendly approach, the culture fishery economy has boomed. In the famous Sardar Sarovar Project on river Narmada,\nplanners had planned that the government would build lined minors going up to\neach Village Service Area (VSA) commanding 200\u2013600 ha; a WUA will build subminors and distribution network within each VSA by mobilizing local resources. As\nit has turned out, planners proposed; and farmers have disposed. Of the 1100 odd\nVSAs so far covered, not one has a WUA that built the distribution system. However,\nthis has not stopped irrigation in the SSP command; thousands of farmers have\ninvested in diesel pumps and rubber pipes; pump irrigation markets have sprung up\neverywhere. According to some, this is certainly not the best solution; planners do\nnot like this irrigation anarchy; but then farmers do not like to lose precious farm\nland and invest own funds for building a distribution system (Talati and Shah 2004).\nGroundwater depletion is one of the most complex challenges India\u2019s people and\nwater policy makers face. However, the responses of the IWRM theoreticians have\ntended to differ from those of the people who are at the receiving end: the former\nthink primarily in terms of ways to reduce groundwater draft through laws and regulations; people have steered clear of demand restriction but have instead mobilized\nlocal resources to increase supply. Rural communities in western India\u2014notably,\nSaurashtra and eastern Rajasthan\u2014have taken to water harvesting and decentralized\ngroundwater recharge in a big way as a mass movement. In southern states, there is\ngrowing tendency to convert irrigation tanks into percolation tanks by sealing the\nconclude that South Asian cities have a long way to go before they can afford water supply systems\nof European or North American quality (see, The Economist, August 15\u201321, 2004).\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n29\n\nsluice gates of tanks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7bf77fe-13f7-4c53-964d-915c533e2046": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7bf77fe-13f7-4c53-964d-915c533e2046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc7ea2eb-eb78-4d3a-99f7-ee6fe64e8b42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51412ca44cdf58dad3feca245aa64f9af3949ecb6e4d80c9187fe212d045c0ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "854e7863-924e-47ff-8fdf-73e82cad9356", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9376aeb7887bc1c83087e9ddecf364b19eaa837fcf9e4de01397465898588dd"}}, "hash": "100fbaf35ec3de5bc907214fa977ceae1995b289fbc2b19b11d458a6636cae60", "text": "In Gujarat, the government has been able to effectively regulate overall groundwater draft for irrigation, not by pricing groundwater and power,\nor creating tradable water rights or making new groundwater laws, but by intelligent\nrationing of farm power supply (Shah and Verma 2008; Shah et al. 2008).\nDeveloping countries like India are then confronted with a policy dilemma of\nwhether to pursue an unachievable ideal\u2014such as the IWRM\u2014or to work with\nwhat they have. Recent discussions in the field of New Institutional Economics\n(NIE) help us to explore this dilemma because it addresses the question \u2018why economies fail to undertake the appropriate activities if they had a high pay-off\u2019 (North\n1990). India\u2019s water sector is replete with situations where appropriate activities can\npotentially generate a high pay-off and yet fail to get undertaken. An institutional\nchange creates a \u2018structure\u2019 of pay-offs with gains varying across different groups\nof agents, and therefore, inviting different \u2018intensities\u2019 of responses. A small group\nof agents each threatened with large loss may put up a stiff resistance to a change\nthat is beneficial for the society as a whole, and vice versa. In NIE, transaction costs\nare seen to include: (a) costs of search and information; (b) costs of negotiation,\nbargaining and contracting; and (c) costs of policing and enforcement of contracts,\nproperty rights, rules and laws. For a policy or institutional intervention, all these\nthree increase directly with the number of agents involved as well as the strength of\ntheir preference for or against the intervention. All the three costs come into play in\ndetermining the \u2018implementation efficacy\u2019 of an institutional intervention because\neach depends on the number of agents involved in a transaction, which in an informal water economy is large.\nA great deal of what policy makers and researchers consider desirable institutional change\u2014such as making and enforcing groundwater regulation, metering\nfarm electricity connections, instituting participatory irrigation management,\nreforming water rights all of which would be part of the IWRM package\u2014are\nextremely difficult to implement on the ground because the transaction costs of\ndoing so are high for implementers and pay-offs are low, even negative, for the\nwater users. In contrast, a plethora of institutional arrangements in the informal sector address various priorities of users, offering them high pay-offs and entailing low\ntransaction costs; yet the State is largely oblivious, even suspicious, of them.\n\n2.6\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe trouble with the \u2018IWRM package\u2019, and indeed the global water governance\ndebate as a whole, is its intent to transform, all at once, a predominantly informal\nwater economy into a predominantly formal one\u2014something that would normally\nbe the result of a long process of economic growth and the transformation that\ncomes in its wake. In the IWRM discourse, formalizing informal water economies\nis improving water governance. But evidence across the world suggests that there is\nno shortcut for a poor society to morph its informal water economy into a formal\none; the process by which this happens is organically tied to wider processes of\n\n \n30\n\nT. Shah and B. van Koppen\n\neconomic growth. When countries try to force the pace of formalization, as they will\nno doubt do, interventions come unstuck. Interventions are more likely to work if\nthey aim to improve the working of a water economy while it is informal.\nImproving water governance worldwide is a work in progress. Countries like the\nUnited States, Spain, Australia, and Mexico struggled with orderly governance of\ntheir agricultural groundwater economies for decades before developing countries\nlike India have had to worry about these problems. And their experience is valuable\ncapital from which the latter societies can draw important lessons. The pioneer\ncountries\u2019 experience does not offer readily applicable solutions, given developing\ncountries\u2019 early stage of economic growth, vast number of small, dispersed water\nabstractors, and a highly informal, atomistic irrigation economies. The solutions\nwould work in portions of water economies, such as urban areas and industrial sectors, that are already formal or easy to formalize. Here, water pricing and regulation\nmust certainly be the way to go. But in a diffuse, atomistic irrigation economy, more\ninventive approaches are called for. The lesson that developing countries need to\ndraw from the pioneer countries is the value of actively engaging with the expanding but unregulated atomistic irrigation economy.\nThree distinctive aspects set India\u2019s water economy apart from the pioneer countries.

Using pricing, tradable water rights, or even policing\nand administrative regulation here is infinitely more difficult in logistical terms than\nin most other countries.\nSecond is the agrarian poverty aspect. Over the past three decades, small-holder\nirrigation based on groundwater revolution has provided more relief\u2014if not a lasting solution\u2014to millions of the region\u2019s agrarian poor than most public policies and\nprograms (Shah 2009). Until population pressure on agriculture eases, public policy\nwill involve tightrope walking to balance conflicting objectives. The government\nwill simultaneously persist with the power subsidies responsible for groundwater\ndepletion and implement watershed development intended to recharge aquifers.\nThis apparent incoherence is symptomatic of the dilemma of water governance in\nIndia. Efforts to cope with or alleviate depletion through supply-side strategies will\ntend to be preferred over aggressive demand-side strategies that threaten\nlivelihoods.\nFinally, the large numbers of dispersed users over a vast countryside present not\nonly a constraint but also a great opportunity for land and water care that sparsely\npopulated countries do not have. The institutional environment here can often\nachieve more by joining forces with farming communities and institutional arrangements than by taking a command-and-control position. Rogers and Hall (2003: 10)\nask, \u201ccan the state steer the society?\u201d In most developing countries \u201cwhich typically\nhave a strong society and a weak state,\u201d the challenge of steering lies in the state\u2019s\nmaking common cause with the multitudes. The mass-based groundwater recharge\nmovement in Saurashtra is but one example of what the state can do in partnership\nwith people. The trouble with regulatory zeal is that it puts the institutional environment and the people in rivalrous relationships when they should be\ncomrades-in-arms.\n\n \n2\n\nThe Precept and Practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\u2026\n\n31\n\nBearing the experiences of the pioneer countries in mind, India needs to look\nwithin to find ways of turning Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma outcomes in Coase outcomes. In\nso doing, they can derive useful guidance from the original IWRM philosophy\u2014\nwhich emphasized participation and dialectics, enjoined societies to move from a\nresource development to resource management, highlighted the insight that a natural resource cannot long remain both scarce and free, and encouraged a process for\nevolving water governance structures tailored to the local context. By so doing,\nIndia may not tame the anarchy in its water economy, but it can achieve a better\ncompromise between its conflicting priorities\u2014providing succor to its agrarian\npoor, and protecting its natural resources and environment.\nFinally, the IWRM paradigm must not be allowed to obfuscate India\u2019s key priorities for years to come, which is making good, sensible investments in improving\nwater infrastructure and services; and making these investments work. We also need\nto bear in mind that as the world\u2019s largest user of groundwater, India\u2019s water economy has a unique dynamic of its own which demands a unique strategic response.\nFinally, as India urbanizes and gets richer, highly formalized segments must emerge\nespecially in cities; direct demand management of the IWRM variety is the ideal\nframework for managing these formal segments, and we should vigorously pursue\nIWRM in these formal segments of our water economy.\n\nReferences\nBandaragoda, D.

However,\nlarge expansion in well irrigation due to policies of promoting private tube well\nconstruction, rural electrification programme and subsidies on electricity and diesel\nfor agricultural use resulted in groundwater over-abstraction largely in northwestern, western and peninsular India. As most of the measures to regulate groundwater overuse in India have met with little success, this chapter examines the\nviability of alternative institutional and economic instruments for sustainable\ngroundwater irrigation.

It came as no surprise that between 1993\u20131994\nand 2006\u20132007, irrigation structures (dug wells and tubewells) pumping groundwater increased from 8.9 to 18.7 million. At present, groundwater nearly sustains 60 %\nof the net irrigated area and about 2/3rd of irrigated food production depends on\nirrigation from groundwater wells (Kumar 2007). Almost all major agricultural\nstates in India heavily depend on groundwater for irrigation. In Tamil Nadu,\nMaharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Gujarat,\ngroundwater caters to more than 60 % of the net irrigated area (CGWB 2006).\nIt has been estimated that crop yield in groundwater irrigated areas is higher by\none third to one half then those irrigated by surface sources (Dhawan 1995).\nProductivity of groundwater irrigation is more than that of surface water because it is\nreliable, available at the point of use, requires minimum conveyance infrastructure,\nand has high application efficiency (Dhawan 1989). Thus in order to optimize crop\nyields and maximize profits from agriculture, farmers intensively use groundwater.\nThough it contributed significantly to agricultural and economic development of the\ncountry, of late it has thrown many challenges for the management and governance of\nthis resource (Singh and Singh 2002). Overdraft of groundwater beyond the recharge\npotential resulted in water scarcity across many regions in India. Out of 5842 number\nof assessed administrative units, nearly 802 are over-exploited, 169 are critical, 523\nare semi-critical and 4277 are safe.1 Further, 71 assessed units are completely Saline.2\nIn Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and\nTamil Nadu, number of over-exploited and critical administrative units are significantly higher (i.e. more than 15 % of the total assessed units) (CGWB 2011).\nWith this context, this chapter discusses the extent of groundwater overexploitation in India, various existing institutional arrangement for groundwater management and the role of alternative approaches and policy instruments in promoting\nsustainable use of groundwater for irrigation.\n\n3.2\n\nExtent of Groundwater Overexploitation in India\n\nGroundwater use for irrigation in India has increased steadily and surpassed canal\nirrigation in the early 1970s (Fig. 3.1). Since mid-1960s, it is actually energized\nirrigation (through electric and diesel operated pumps) that has increased more.\nBetween 1961 and 2002, number of electric pumps increased from mere 0.2 to 10.3\nmillion, and diesel pumps increased from 0.2 to 6.5 million. The expansion of energised irrigation is attributed to: (1) government programs to promote private tubewells, supported by soft loans to farmers and rural electrification (Scott and Sharma\n2009); (2) the general shift to a flat rate electricity tariff for agricultural use in most\nstates (Janakarajan and Moench 2006; Scott and Sharma 2009); and (3) diesel\nsubsidy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c282bcb9-12f1-48a5-b8ec-ba6e33d6e820": {"__data__": {"id_": "c282bcb9-12f1-48a5-b8ec-ba6e33d6e820", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "365a13e1-3eb8-4362-afad-f0316860a9cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cac71cbda93eb70809794faadd64409c893cd7063bfe01586bd15a152d594286"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f39fc5f-69f2-4408-8b54-f95d25eae807", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4704bfe4d1d96bf0db291744b8dcd44edcd62255d4f46e0e3e49b96f21732bd"}}, "hash": "dd89d92cce278590a7a055a1ef0734826ffecaee334d5dba802b1e1f0c5e0255", "text": "Such ambitious interventions led to overdependence and overuse of\n1\n\nAn administrative unit is categorized as: overexploited if the stage of groundwater development is\nmore than 100 %; critical if it is between 90 % and 100 %; semi-critical if it is between 70 % and\n90 %; and safe if it is below 70 %.\n2\nSaline units are those where the entire assessment area is having poor quality groundwater.\n\n \n3\n\nGroundwater Depletion in India: Potential of Alternative Approaches and Policy\u2026\n\n37\n\nFig. 3.1 Source wise net irrigated area (Source: Author\u2019s own analysis using data tables from\nIndiastat)\n\ngroundwater for irrigation in many parts of the country. This resulted in declining\ngroundwater level, reduction in supply, saline water encroachment (Singh and Singh\n2002; Narayanamoorthy 2010), drying of the springs and shallow aquifers, increased\ncost of lifting, reduction in free flow and even local subsidence at some places\n(Singh and Singh 2002). Lack of well-defined ownership rights in groundwater too\ncontributed to its unsustainable use.\nAs a consequence of overuse of groundwater for irrigation, 37 % of the total\nassessed administrative units in Karnataka, 37 % of the total units in Tamil nadu, 49\n% of total units in Haryana, 59 % of the total units in Rajasthan and 75 % of the total\nunits in Punjab were found to be overexploited (CGWB 2006). These figures are\nmuch above the average figure (which is 15 %) of the country\u2019s total overexploited\nadministrative units. However, it is argued that the current assessment of groundwater\nover-exploitation did not provide a clear picture of the actual extent of over-exploitation\nin both absolute and relative terms. It tends to underestimate the magnitude of groundwater overexploitation in India, which can be assessed from the negative social, economic and ecological consequences of over-development (Kumar and Singh 2008).\nFrom that perspective, many districts in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil\nNadu could be actually over-exploited, though the official figures show that they fall\nunder \u201csafe\u201d, \u201csemi-critical\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d categories. The regions which have serious\nproblems are alluvial Punjab, both the hard and alluvial areas of Gujarat, and the hard\nrock areas of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.\nNonetheless, large-scale overexploitation of the groundwater resource has serious consequences for the Indian subcontinent where hard rock (consolidated) formations cover almost 70 % of the total area. In these hard rock areas, mainly in\nwater scarce Western and Peninsular India, recharge of aquifers is comparatively\nlow and often occurs at places having fissure or cracks or weathering in the rock\nformations. In general groundwater potential of hard rock areas is poor (Fig. 3.2),\nthough relatively high yields may be obtained in restricted locations under favorable\n\n \n38\n\nN.

Therefore any form of overexploitation seriously affects the groundwater availability and contributes to well\nfailures in these regions (Bassi 2011).\nOver the years, though the total number of irrigation wells in the hard rock\nregions has increased, there is a simultaneous increase in abandoned or failed wells\n(Fig. 3.3). Further, in some states, increase in number of wells has not contributed to\ncorresponding increase in groundwater irrigated area. For example in Tamil Nadu,\nit was found that with the increase in number of wells there is no major increase in\ngroundwater irrigated area after 1980s (Janakarajan and Moench 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f39fc5f-69f2-4408-8b54-f95d25eae807": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f39fc5f-69f2-4408-8b54-f95d25eae807", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c282bcb9-12f1-48a5-b8ec-ba6e33d6e820", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd89d92cce278590a7a055a1ef0734826ffecaee334d5dba802b1e1f0c5e0255"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc401c3e-3a10-4964-94e0-0e8b5c7074e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8e2f7ef55f08305ec08f09f69f79f8eb03900e2300531f2360d80c69b763a42"}}, "hash": "a4704bfe4d1d96bf0db291744b8dcd44edcd62255d4f46e0e3e49b96f21732bd", "text": "Similarly,\n\n \nGroundwater Depletion in India: Potential of Alternative Approaches and Policy\u2026\n\n00-01\n\n1200000\n600000\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nMaharashtra\n\nFailed /\nAbandoned\n\nIn Use\n\nFailed /\nAbandoned\n\nFailed /\nAbandoned\n\nIn Use\n\nFailed /\nAbandoned\n\n0\nIn Use\n\nNo. of Irrigation Wells\n\n93-94\n\n39\n\n1800000\n\nIn Use\n\n3\n\nTamil Nadu\n\nFig. 3.3 Well failures in hard rock regions, India (Source: Author\u2019s own analysis using data from\nminor irrigation census and Indiastat)\n\nin five districts of Madhya Pradesh namely Balghat, Chhindwara, Shahdol, Jhabua\nand Betul, the average command area of energized wells was observed to be declining almost consistently after mid 1970s (Kumar 2007). On the other side there are\nareas in the Gangetic river basin, mostly comprising alluvial aquifers in Bihar and\nWest Bengal, with comparatively less development of groundwater resources (39 %\nand 42 % respectively). The reasons are: (1) small and fragmented land holdings; (2)\nlow number of water extraction mechanisms; (3) high cost of energy; and (4) low\ninvestment capacity of small and marginal farmers (Sharma et al. 2008). Along with\neconomic water scarcity, these are the areas which also face scarcity of arable land.\nAs a result, development of groundwater for irrigation and overall agricultural\ngrowth is very low in this water rich eastern part of India (Kumar et al. 2011).\n\n3.3\n\nInstitutional Arrangements for Groundwater\nManagement in India\n\nIn context of groundwater management, institutional arrangements include formal\nlaws dealing with groundwater, irrigation laws and their regulations, and informal\nnorms regarding groundwater development and use (Kemper 2007). Some past\nlegal attempts include Bombay Irrigation (Gujarat Amendment) Act of 1976 (on\nwell depth restriction), Pondicherry Groundwater (Control and Regulation) Act of\n2002 (on well spacing restriction) and Andhra Pradesh Water, Land, and Trees Act\nof 2002 (dealing with well registration and ban on well construction in notified villages). More recent is the Maharashtra Groundwater (Management and Development)\nAct 2009 which envisages several restrictions such as, ban on the construction of\nwells; prohibition on groundwater pumping from the existing deep-wells (more\n\n \n40\n\nN. Bassi\n\nthan 60 m deep); stipulation on deep-wells users to follow the groundwater use plan\nand crop plan.\nIn pursuance of these legislations, many direct and indirect measures were\nadopted for groundwater management in India. These include: artificial recharge in\nareas facing problems of overdraft; direct regulation of groundwater abstraction;\nindirect regulations through well financing and other leverages; local management\nof groundwater by user groups; and establishment of cooperative property rights in\ngroundwater. However, most of these measures have met with little success and\nhave been ineffective in arresting groundwater depletion (Janakarajan 2002; Kumar\n2005). Moreover, the 1992 Model Groundwater Bill which advocates well permits,\nwater metering, and withdrawal limits has not been properly adopted by any state so\nfar (Saleth and Dinar 2000). But of late, direct institutional instruments; such as\nestablishment of water rights and effective enforcement of legislations, and indirect\neconomic instruments; such as power rationing (Scott and Shah 2004; Shah et al.\n2008) and pro rata electricity pricing (Gupta 2002; Kumar 2005; Kumar et al. 2011),\nfor managing groundwater demand are being increasingly advocated.\n\n3.4\n\nCan Water Rights and Energy Pricing Emerge as Better\nOptions?\n\nThe spatial and temporal variation in both water availability and demand is very\nhigh in India. In eastern regions, such as states of Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and\nWest Bengal, though water resources are abundant, irrigation demand is very low.\nFurther, problems of water logging due to rising groundwater levels caused by\nflooding and excessive irrigation from canals are encountered (Shah 2001). On the\nother hand, demand for water is extremely high in water scarce arid and semi-arid\nregions of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra, where groundwater is\nthe major source of water for all purposes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc401c3e-3a10-4964-94e0-0e8b5c7074e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc401c3e-3a10-4964-94e0-0e8b5c7074e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f39fc5f-69f2-4408-8b54-f95d25eae807", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4704bfe4d1d96bf0db291744b8dcd44edcd62255d4f46e0e3e49b96f21732bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "61012abc-deea-439a-9522-0dda5512576b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "494446cf88427dc1cbafec6b0cf611022410b471ad04dcc1b00aeb84433759f1"}}, "hash": "c8e2f7ef55f08305ec08f09f69f79f8eb03900e2300531f2360d80c69b763a42", "text": "Pumping regulations in these areas facing overdevelopment problems through groundwater legislation, control of institutional financing for well development, and restrictions on power connections for\npumps have been ineffective (Janakarajan 2002; Kumar 2000).\nIt is argued that even an imperfect system of groundwater rights will have more\nsustainable benefits than a most perfectly designed power tariff structure (Saleth\n1997). Many other scholars in the past have also suggested establishment of property rights as a means to build institutional capability to ensure equity in allocation\nand efficiency in use of water across sectors (Saleth 1994; Narain 1998; Kumar\n2000). Other institutional mechanisms, such as groundwater legislations, to check\nand control overdraft have fallen flat due to their social and political implications.\nThe issue of effective water rights is particularly important for irrigation water\nwhich has significant implication for agricultural sustainability (Saleth 1994).\nScott and Shah (2004) claimed that strict rationing of power supply to agriculture\nin India is having an unintended consequence of limiting the rate of groundwater\nexploitation. Further based on power reforms in Gujarat, Shah et al. (2008) argued\n\n \n3\n\nGroundwater Depletion in India: Potential of Alternative Approaches and Policy\u2026\n\n41\n\nthat metering electricity use by tubewells and charging farmers at rates based on\npower consumption is detrimental to the marginal and landless farmers who largely\ndepend on groundwater markets and hence, unlikely to happen in near future.\nTherefore best intermediate strategy is to provide good quality rationed power but at\na common flat rate tariff to all tubewells regardless of whether metered or not\nmetered. Citing example from water rich eastern state of West Bengal, Mukherji\n(2007) supported the view that high flat-rate electricity tariff encourages development of water markets whereby the water buyers, mostly small and marginal farmers,\nbenefit from access to irrigation. But these views do not hold true in case of western\nand peninsular India which are water scarce and already facing increased problem of\ngroundwater depletion due to continuing subsidized energy regimes for groundwater\npumping. Researchers have indicated that energy rationing but without metering and\nunit pricing have failed to motivate farmers to use water and electricity efficiently\n(IRAP 2010). For instance, in Gujarat where Jyotigram scheme of rationalized power\nsupply to farm sector was launched during 2003\u20132006, agricultural power consumption has actually increased from 9,571 million units in 2002\u20132003 to 11,009 million\nunits in 2006\u20132007 (Data Source: Gujarat Electricity Board). Whereas, Kumar\n(2005) showed that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency\nand productivity positively. In fact, Kumar et al. (2011) has provided empirical evidence that raising power tariffs in the farm sector to achieve efficiency and sustainability of groundwater use is both socially and economically viable.\n\n3.5\n\nWater Rights as an Instrument to Manage Groundwater\n\nIn India, groundwater property structure has remained relatively unchanged since\ncolonial era (Aguilar 2011). Based on the \u2018dominant heritage\u2019 principle implied in\nthe Transfer of Property Act IV of 1882, the Easement Act of 1882 deems groundwater to be an easement connected to the land and grants landowners an unrestricted\nright to use the groundwater below the land (Saleth 2010). Since the land and well\nownership is heavily skewed, there is an inherent inequality in access to groundwater (Kumar 2007). A formal system of water rights can mitigate this inequity in\ngroundwater access and can also promote its sustainable use (Rosegrant and\nBinswanger 1994; Saleth 1994).\nOver-exploitation occurs when users ignore the effects of their actions on the\nresource and other users when pursuing their own self interests (Johansson et al.\n2002). For instance, in Gujarat, where there are well developed informal groundwater markets, water is sold without considering the limits of the resource. Though the\nallocation of purchased water may be more efficient than in absence of such markets, the groundwater level is nevertheless being drawn down (Kemper 2007).\nUnder such scenario, absence of well-defined private property rights can be a major\nsource of uncertainty about the negative environmental impacts of resource use,\nleading to its unsustainable use (Pearce and Warford 1993; Kay et al. 1997; Kumar\n2003). Once the resource becomes scarce, well defined groundwater use rights can\nbecome a key mechanism to control over-abstraction (Kemper 2007). Saleth (1994)\nnotes that the more robust, though politically and administratively harder, options\n\n \n42\n\nN.

However, the water rights administrative agency has to ensure that water rights granted will not result in annual\npumping quantities that exceed safe yield (Peck 2003).\nIf the rights are allocated only to use water, it can create incentives to use it even\nwhen there is no good use of it. Therefore, water rights have to be tradable (Frederick\n1993). Also, transferability and exchangeability of water rights are crucial to capture and reflect the scarcity value of water through price signal and guide water\nallocation accordingly (Saleth 1994). Well-defined tradable rights (especially in\ncontext of developing countries) formalize and secure the existing water rights\nenjoyed by water users; economize on transactions costs; induce water users to\nconsider the full opportunity cost of water; and provide incentives for water users to\ninternalize and reduce many of the negative externalities inherent in irrigation\n(Rosegrant and Binswanger 1994). Thus, the highest value of water use is taken into\naccount and provides an incentive to users for more efficient use and reallocation of\nsurplus water to a higher valued use (Kumar 2003; Kemper 2007). Empirical evidences from the functioning of groundwater irrigation institutions in north Gujarat\nshow that under a system of fixed volumetric water use rights, farmers prefer to\ngrow mustard, which is less water intensive, in larger area as compared to wheat,\nthough the earlier one has much lower land use productivity than wheat, but getting\nsame water use productivity (Kumar 2000, 2005). Further, volumetric pricing of\nwater and its rationing as found in the shareholders of tube-well partnerships, farmers allocate their entitlements for growing crops that give higher economic returns\nfrom every unit of water used for crop production (Kumar 2005). But for a tradable\ngroundwater use right to resolve overexploitation of groundwater aquifers, a definite proportion of the aquifer volume needs to be reserved to achieve a certain stabilization (Kemper 2007) on sustainable yield considerations (Kumar 2005).\nFurther, there is a need to separate rights to groundwater from right to land as it\nhas constrained the potential for inter-sectoral allocation. Considering that agricultural use accounts for more than 80 % of water use, the modest transfer of water from\nagriculture could meet growing urban and industrial demands. As evident from other\nparts of the world, the infrastructure required for such inter-sectoral water transfers\nwould cost much less than the large hydraulic infrastructures planned to meet growing water demand for domestic and industrial uses (Mohanty and Gupta 2002).\n\n3.6\n\nPricing Energy for Limiting Groundwater Use\n\nIt is a common knowledge that users have an incentive to use a resource more efficiently when it is priced appropriately (Kemper 2007). In case of groundwater,\nenergy pricing is important in developing economies like India where energy subsidies to agriculture are estimated between USD 1.9 billion and USD 6.5 billion per\nyear. Further, the electricity subsidies to agriculture in India are estimated to be 26\n\n \n3\n\nGroundwater Depletion in India: Potential of Alternative Approaches and Policy\u2026\n\n43\n\n% of the gross fiscal deficit. These range from 80 % in Madhya Pradesh and Haryana\nto 50 % in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, and to about 40 % in Rajasthan,\nPunjab and Tamil Nadu (Bhatia 2005). These are also the states which are experiencing tremendous groundwater over-abstraction for irrigation. Hence, the \u2018pro\npoor\u2019 subsidies regime has affected both groundwater situation and the state finances\nalike; and has already turned \u2018anti-poor\u2019 in several regions of Peninsular and Western\nIndia where the aquifers are already over-exploited and only the rich and large farm\nowners can afford to abstract water.\nEarlier, many researchers have suggested rational pricing of electricity as a\npotential fiscal tool for sustainable groundwater use in India (Moench 1995; Saleth\n1997; Kumar 2005; Kumar et al. 2011). Many argue that a flat rate based pricing\nstructure in the farm sector creates an incentive for farmers to over-extract it, as the\nmarginal cost of extraction is zero (Kumar 2005). Some researchers have argued that\nsince the price at which groundwater is traded in regions like north Gujarat reflect\nthe scarcity value of the resource, tariff hike would not have significant impact on\ngroundwater use (Mohanty and Ebrahim 1995).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac292a24-5786-42e1-8411-2ba9562940ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac292a24-5786-42e1-8411-2ba9562940ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "61012abc-deea-439a-9522-0dda5512576b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "494446cf88427dc1cbafec6b0cf611022410b471ad04dcc1b00aeb84433759f1"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7bbbcf4-d386-4085-9119-f77043e7483f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "60ad1aaf44e02e3487325092ffefcc10de2e8ab00da1489edd202c328abe789c"}}, "hash": "a37fb8a70b7c7f9268c7215c84d66b3e3a5a097406ac9d644547bbde727a0508", "text": "However, such arguments are contested on the ground that the actual annual demand for irrigation services in hourly\nterms is much smaller in comparison to the total amount of groundwater the well\nowners can pump out during a year and that they are not confronted with the opportunity cost of using excess water for irrigating their own fields (Kumar and Singh\n2001). Nevertheless, some scholars continue to advocate that the flat tariff regime\nwith power supply rationing and supply management is the highly rationale, sophisticated and scientific pricing regime (Shah et al. 2007). But field studies suggest that\npower rationing with good quality supply but without metering and unit pricing has\nfailed to arrest groundwater over-exploitation (IRAP 2010).\nIt is quite true that the policies with regard to water and electricity pricing are\nguided by strong political and economic considerations (Moench 1995). Once a\nsubsidized regime is set, it is politically very difficult to return to energy prices that\nactually reflect the cost of energy to state (Kemper 2007). But the recent past has\nseen some remarkable success in introducing metering, and charging a power tariff\nbased on actual consumption in some states. These include West Bengal (Mukherji\net al. 2009), Uttarakhand (Bassi et al. 2007), and Gujarat (Kumar et al. 2011). In\nmany Indian states farmers have been crying foul over the deteriorating power supply, which is free or highly subsidized, and instead were demanding a good quality\npower supply with a price. A field research study undertaken in Madhya Pradesh\nconfirmed that it is actually small and marginal farmers who have been affected\nmost by the subsidized power driven groundwater overexploitation as they have\nlimited resources and access to groundwater (Bassi et al. 2008). It was further analysed that the aggregate net returns per farmer for small landholders were 41 % less\nthan the large landowners. Similarly, aggregate net returns per well for small landholders were 39 % less than the large landowners (Fig. 3.4).\nCiting the case of the aquifers of the Lower Jordan River Basin, Venot and Molle\n(2008) argued that any substantial increase in volumetric charges is unlikely to\nenable regulation of groundwater abstraction and would further decrease the income\nfrom low-value or extensive crops.

However,\nthe empirical studies carried out so far on the issue of energy pricing on groundwater use in India show that the introduction of consumption-based pricing of electricity and an increase in unit charges, if combined with improvement in the quality of\npower supply, will lead to greater agricultural income and a reduction in use of\ngroundwater (IRMA/UNICEF 2001; Kumar 2005; Kumar et al. 2011). Scott and\nShah (2004) held that a zero or flat-rate tariff provides no incentive to limit pumping; however, the increases in metered tariff required for elastic demand behaviour\nare likely to be significantly higher than are acceptable to either farmers or politicians (also refer to de Fraiture and Perry 2002). However, empirical studies in North\nGujarat (Kumar 2005) and in South Bihar, Eastern UP and north Gujarat (Kumar\net al. 2011) established that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and\ngroundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable.\nSome researchers have also questioned the feasibility of installing meters at such\na large scale because of the huge transaction cost involved in it (Shah et al. 2007).\nHowever they were found to be rather excuses used by officials and other functionaries of electricity departments to cover up the revenue losses due to poor operational efficiencies, resulting from transmission losses and distribution losses,\nincluding thefts (Kumar 2009).

In\nIndia, overdraft appears to be occurring in regions which experience low to medium\nrainfall with high aridity (Kumar and Singh 2008). Metering and pro rata pricing of\nelectricity may not be required in those regions which have abundant groundwater, if\nthe issue of cost recovery in electricity supply can be addressed through other modes\nof pricing. The reason is that metering is essentially an economic decision and the\nbenefits of metering have to justify the efforts involved (Arghyam/IRAP 2010). In\nwater-abundant regions, the social and economic benefits of groundwater conservation\nthrough metering may not be very significant. Therefore, in those regions, the pricing\nstructure should be designed in such a way that it encourages greater use of groundwater for boosting agricultural production. But caution should be exercised, to see that it\ndoes not create negative effects on equity in distribution of energy subsidy benefits.\nThe flat system of pricing, based on the connected load of the pump set, can be a good\nbasis for pricing electricity in groundwater abundant areas (Kumar et al. 2011).\n\n3.7\n\nConclusion and Policy Implication\n\nThe number of groundwater wells in India has almost doubled during the last two\ndecades. Further, incidence of well failures has been on rise especially in regions\ncharacterized by poor specific yield and groundwater potential. These instances\ngive clear signs of aquifer depletion which requires some immediate solution.\nHowever, existing state regulations concerning groundwater management have been\nable to achieve little. Additionally, compliance with age old colonial laws and policy\nof providing free or subsidized energy supply for irrigation use has resulted in overexploitation of aquifer and misuse of abstracted groundwater. Though started as a\npro-poor policy initiative, energy subsidies are quickly turning into pro-rich policy\ninitiatives by allowing resource rich farmers to continue more pumping.\nEnforcement of private and tradable water rights in groundwater can together\nbring about a significant increase in farm outputs, with a reduction in aggregate\ndemand for water in agriculture. It will also bring about more equitable access to,\nand control over, the water available from groundwater for food production and\nensure household-level food security. In this formal regime, small farmers and the\npoor will gain water rights, which would empower them, and can serve as additional\ncollateral (Mohanty and Gupta 2002). This has to be complemented by the pro rata\npricing of electricity in the farm sector, with improved quality and reliability of the\nsupplied power. Flat tariff regimes, whether rationed or managed, can do little to\ncontrol groundwater and energy use in agriculture. Therefore, metering and pro rata\npricing of electricity has to receive priority, especially in naturally water-scarce\nregions which also experience groundwater over-draft. Whereas, in the groundwaterabundant eastern region of India, the pricing structure in the farming sector should\nbe designed in such a way that it encourages greater use of groundwater. However,\nin such areas there is a limit to agricultural growth as availability of per capita arable\nland becomes a constraint.\n\n \n46\n\nN. Bassi\n\nReferences\nAguilar, D. (2011).

Cronin, Anjal Prakash, Praveena Sridhar, and Sue Coates\nAbstract India has made significant progress in developing its water resources and\nthe supporting drinking water infrastructure. In fact, it has met the water target for\nits MDG commitment and in doing so has contributed significantly to the global\nachievement of this target. However, rapid development, increasing population and\nvariable resource distribution has led to the current demand for water outweighing\nsupply.\nLarge budgetary outlays since independence and a high political focus on drinking water have resulted in the country supplying water through improved sources to\n92 % of its citizens. Improved sources, as per Joint Monitoring Program definitions,\ndo not reflect the safety of the water supplied. Also improved sources do not result\nnecessarily in improved health and nutrition outcomes due to other factors; the principal being poor sanitation and hygiene. This chapter will, therefore, deal with\nwater along with sanitation and hygiene.\nLike any other basic service, to be delivered efficiently the institutions responsible for them play a crucial role. Clear delegation of responsibilities is essential\nfor this. This is not the case in India today with numerous institutions with duplicate roles and also significant gaps. In addition, inadequate institutional performance, lack of appetite for reforms and ineffective implementation of existing\nprovisions have affected the performance levels for water supply, in both the\nrural and urban contexts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e4c506c-f44a-4c3a-85de-ddc1c0912fec": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e4c506c-f44a-4c3a-85de-ddc1c0912fec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8d7dccb-3821-4d83-9e0a-1f52d1178dd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3cadee9fcfa18c46c1edc046fa427675f62e2804d1519b06435ab991e6c607fa"}, "3": {"node_id": "846d4133-a745-49e4-9a97-688de9a87f5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27602bf2a86ab5062eec8bde0cb307852256765edc2abe7b9010c59aed7ea8f2"}}, "hash": "21f47d8ab55c578209643beccce270985c56661007d34abc8d1990b44cef6a23", "text": "Besides the institutional challenges, other factors\naffecting water supply in India include political will, environmental sustainability (including climate change), social dynamics, technological appropriateness\nand economics.\n\nA.A.

This paper examines the landscape challenges and opportunities for improved drinking water supply in India.\nPositive developments can be seen in the recommendations for the 12th Five Year\nplan but will require systematic implementation of reforms and a strong political will.\nKeywords Drinking water \u2022 Policy \u2022 Supply \u2022 India\n\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIndia has lost more than 600,000 children under 5 years in 2010 due to diarrhea and\npneumonia (UNICEF 2012a); almost 30 % of the global total. Water, sanitation and\nhygiene (WASH) plays a critical role in combating these killers. Eighty-eight percent of diarrhea deaths are linked to incomplete water and sanitation service provision (Fewtrell et al. 2007). Stunting is thought to contribute to over a third of under\nfive deaths globally (UNICEF 2012b). India has the largest number of stunted children in the world with over 40 % moderately or severely underweight (NFHS-3\n2006). Stunting depends on food intake, the general health status of the child and\nthe physical environment; WASH cross-cuts all these aspects and it has been estimated that 50 % of malnutrition is attributable to water, sanitation and hygiene\n(Fewtrell et al. 2007). A recent study (WSP 2010) estimates that inadequate sanitation causes India \u2018considerable economic losses\u2019, equivalent to 6.4 % of India\u2019s\ngross domestic product (GDP) in 2006 (US$53.8 billion). These are all unacceptably high figures for a country of India\u2019s standing and ambition.\nIndia has about 16 % of the world\u2019s population as compared to only 4 % of its\nwater resources. With the present population of more than 1.2 billion, the per capita\nwater availability is down to around 1,170 cu m/person/year (NIH 2010). Despite\nthese constraints, it is to India\u2019s credit that the provision of safe drinking water has\ntaken great strides. India has contributed more than any other country to those gaining access to improved drinking water sources in the world, 522 million between\n1990 and 2010 and has met the Millennium Development Goal for water (WHO/\nUNICEF 2012). These numbers are commendable but when the data is looked at in\nmore detail, it is clear not all have benefitted equally. This is a key issue that has to\nbe addressed as equity has been highlighted in the 12th Five Year by the Planning\nCommission of India (Planning Commission 2010, 2011).\nDrinking water fits into the broader water sector. This sector is complex, interlinked and requires a holistic systems approach to develop a full understanding\nranging from political, environmental, social, institutional and economical\n(UNICEF, FAO and SaciWATERs. 2013). This is true in all countries, but especially\nwith the competing interests and priorities at play in developing countries and middle income countries like India.\nGiven this need for a holistic approach, this chapter unpacks the challenges and\nthen develops the future possibilities. The chapter is divided into five sections.

Section 4.5 maps the challenges of the sector in supplying water for all.\n\n4.2\n\nHistory of Indian Water Supply Policy\nand Implementation\n\nThe journey of planned efforts in water supply and sanitation in India began in 1949\nwhen the Environmental Sanitation Committee, Govt. of India, recommended a goal\nof supplying safe water to 90 % of the country\u2019s population over the next 40 years.\nIn 1950 the Constitution of India listed water as a State subject. Article 47 of the\nConstitution conferred the duty of providing clean drinking water and improving\npublic health standards to the State Governments. This set the background for governing and managing water in the successive Five Year Plans. This evolution of\nthinking and planning is grouped into four groups, called First to Fourth generation\nprograms (Sridhar 2012) and the corresponding milestones are illustrated in Fig. 4.1.\nThese generations of programs focus on rural water supply and sanitation. Urban\nwater supply scenario has been different from the rural in a way that the progression\nof planning efforts as well as institutional structures shows a distinct trajectory.\nFigure 4.2 illustrates developments in urban water supply over the years. The timeline of developments in both \u2013 rural and urban \u2013 water sectors is provided to suggest\na comprehensive way of looking at the developments in these areas rather than\nexamining separate programs in isolation. A wider temporal perspective offers context and insight into why a particular program was launched.\n\n4.2.1\n\nRural Water Supply and Sanitation\n\nFirst Generation Programs The first Five Year Plan (1951\u20131956) allocated\napproximately 1.5 % of the total budget to water and sanitation. The allocation\nremained roughly the same until 1969 when the National Rural Drinking Water\nSupply Program (NRDWP), was launched, with technical support from UNICEF. The\neffort mainly comprised drilling bore wells and building piped water infrastructure.\nThe fourth Five Year Plan (1969\u20131974) saw a near doubling of budgetary allocation.\nDuring this plan the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Program (ARWSP) was\nlaunched in 1972. This goal of this program was to increase the pace of drinking\nwater supply coverage which had grown at a sluggish pace until this time. ARWSP\nmade significant progress in the next decade, during which the budgetary allocation\nto water and sanitation also peaked at 4.15 % under the Sixth Five Year Plan (Fig. 4.1).\n\n \nFig. 4.1 Timeline of rural drinking water supply and sanitation in India (Sridhar 2012)\n\n52\nA.A. Cronin et al.\n\n \nFig. 4.2 Timeline of urban drinking water supply and sanitation in India (Sridhar 2012)\n\n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n53\n\n \n54\n\nA.A. Cronin et al.\n\nSecond Generation Programs A national level apex committee was setup in 1981\nto define policies to guide India to provide access to safe water in all its villages.\nThis lead to formation of National Drinking Water Mission (NDWM) in 1986 followed by first National Water Policy in 1987 by the Ministry of Water Resources.\nAdditionally, a Technology Mission was launched in 1986\u20131987 in which appropriate technology intervention, water quality, human resource development and support were introduced in Rural Water Supply sector. The Technology Mission was\nlater renamed as Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission (RGNDWM) in\n1991 (Fig. 4.1).\nThird Generation Programs The National Water Policy was revised in 2002.\nVillages that did not have adequate sources of safe water were prioritized and level\nof service in partially covered villages was planned to be improved, under this revision. In the same year India committed to UN Millennium Development Goals to\nhalve by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking\nwater and basic sanitation, from 1990 levels. The Swajaldhara program was\nlaunched in 2002 which changed the way in which water and sanitation services\nwere supported in rural areas. Swajaldhara decentralized service delivery responsibility to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and users. This new approach advocated\nfor communities to be consulted and empowered in the planning process via a participatory approach; and from this to enter into a cost sharing agreement with the\nlocal authorities. For the first time users agreed to pay an upfront tariff for water use,\nthat was significantly increased to cover the operation and maintenance costs.\nSwajaldhara continued till 2009 when the National Rural Drinking Water Program\n(NRDWP) was introduced.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7346b0a-285a-470c-9e21-58e224a2e8ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7346b0a-285a-470c-9e21-58e224a2e8ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "846d4133-a745-49e4-9a97-688de9a87f5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27602bf2a86ab5062eec8bde0cb307852256765edc2abe7b9010c59aed7ea8f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb344d30-96f6-4b53-b459-a215d6a82a46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e21adf22442b2529c049521ebcc330be1cddb71bb7476a09087137fd82c15252"}}, "hash": "8d104e1b957e7c6f69b6e98349aa16605a35f837a54ba6c974aa9a2bdbf81271", "text": "NRDWP drew on experiences from ARWSP and continues until now.\nFourth Generation The Rural Water Supply sector today appears remarkably different in its approach and prioritization of issues, in comparison to the earlier generations. A significant difference lies in the shift from top-down and technology\ndriven approaches to a decentralized one which lays greater emphasis on aspects like\nsustainability, equity and community participation. Ensuring sustainability of water,\nits availability in terms of pot ability, adequacy, convenience, affordability and equity\nare given priority in the latest programs. All this is to be achieved while ensuring\ndecentralized approach which involves PRIs and community organizations.\nAs in other areas of governance the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments\nwere a landmark development in water sector. Now, with the amendments Panchayati\nRaj Institutions were given the responsibility of providing drinking water. The\nDepartment of Drinking Water Supply was renamed as Department of Drinking\nWater and Sanitation in 2010, which was later upgraded into the Ministry of\nDrinking Water and Sanitation (MDWS) in 2011. A dedicated Minster solely in\ncharge of MDWS was appointed in 2012.\nMeanwhile, sanitation developed separately from drinking water, with the launch\nof Central Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP) in 1986, though was planned and\nimplemented in conjugation with drinking water programs. By the 1990s although\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n55\n\nprogress was being made in water, sanitation coverage remained abysmally low. To\ngive increased impetus to progress and address known bottlenecks, in 1999 the Total\nSanitation Campaign (TSC) was launched. This program is a restructured version of\nthe CRS. TSC also included a component of building water and sanitation facilities\nin schools. TSC evolved into Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in 2012, with increased\nhousehold subsidy and linkage with the rural employment guarantee scheme.\nIt can be said that in rural water supply and sanitation the focus was on technology\nuntil the lack of policy was felt. Policies affected a comprehensive approach to the\nsector but the gaps remained unaddressed. These gaps included sanitation, community\nengagement and increasing emphasis on demand over supply. Attempts to address\nthese over the two decades have been through restructuring of departments, decentralization of local level planning as well as responsibilities from the centre to the lower\nlevels of the democratic structure. More recently the importance of community\nengagement, gender, flexibility in central funding along with increased financial outlays have helped raise the profile and priority of the sector, especially sanitation.\n\n4.2.2\n\nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation\n\nAbout 32 % of Indian population is urban spread across 474 urban agglomerations\nacross the country, 31 of these have a population in excess of one million. Presently\n97 % of population has access to improved water supply and 58 % has access to sanitation. Urban water supply was separated from rural water supply and given exclusive attention with the formation of Central Public Health and Environment\nEngineering Organization (CPHEEO). This organization was to assist Ministry of\nUrban Development in its functioning. CPHEEO began to conduct PHE trainings\nspecifically to produce professionals trained in water supply and sanitation. Sanitation\nin urban context was seen in association with water but its introduction as a focus\narea happened much later in rural context. To remove the practice of open defecation\nand manual scavenging in urban areas Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) was\nintroduced in 1980. Improvement of infrastructure to address basic needs of smaller\nurban agglomerations and to avoid migration from smaller habitations to bigger habitations Integrated Development of Small and Medium Towns (IDSMT) was initiated\nin 1978. But in spite of these programs little progress was made in the state of urban\nwater and sanitation. Part of the reason for this was allocation of funds. The rate of\nurbanization over years was not proportional to the funds allocated to deal with water\nand sanitation demand. The other reason was that the Urban Water Supply (UWSS)\ndid not have exclusive and targeted programs to attend to the requirements of water\nand sanitation that emerged in the urban areas.

Cronin et al.\n\nNehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) with improved budgetary allocation and increased scope to schemes. These programs have helped introduce wide\nranging changes in planning, implementation as well as maintenance of water and\nsanitation services in urban areas. But this has yet to achieve the scale of results\nrequired; also due to the variety of structural challenges (administrative, political,\nand social) that are constantly at play and affect the state of water and sanitation in\nurban areas and which are further described below.\n\n4.3\n\nWater Supply Institutional Structure and Delivery\nMechanisms\n\nGoverning water resources and their use, along with servicing basic needs (drinking\nwater, sanitation and health) to over 1.2 billion people, requires an extensive system\nof institutions at various levels aided by numerous special purpose agencies (Fig.\n4.3). The federal structure of India requires that there is clarity in responsibilities at\nCentre, State, and sub-State levels. It is important to understand the institutional\nstructure and related responsibilities to fully comprehend the water landscape and in\nidentifying the critical points in the decision making to implementation chain.\n\n4.3.1\n\nRural Institutional Structure\n\nThe Central government is the facilitator of the entire process; its role is to set policy, guide investments in the sector, help States with funding, training, research,\nquality monitoring and human resource development. Under the aegis of MDWS,\nthe National Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC) sanctions funds to States. The\nsanctioning process is closely monitored and heavy emphasis is placed on financial\nexpenditure. Impact of these funds is less closely scrutinized.\nThe States plan, design and execute water and sanitation programs. The State\ngovernments are supported by various departments including Public Health\nEngineering Department (PHED), Rural Development Department, Water Boards\nand PRIs. It should be noted that States may have different institutional setups in\naccordance with the local context. In some states water supply and sanitation\nprograms are supported by PHED, whereas in some it is the Panchayat and Rural\nDevelopment Department and in some it is the Rural Development Department. At\na lower level PRIs play a crucial role in the process as most of the implementation\nand ground action takes place here. Going further, the PRIs are required to takeover\nplanning of the programs at the village level.\nThe highest sanitation authority at the State level is the State Water and Sanitation\nMission (SWSM) which is aided by a State Level Scheme Sanctioning Committee\n(SLSCC), Capacity and Community Development Unit (CCDU) and State Technical\nAgency (STA). The Water Supply and Sanitation Organization (WSSO) works\n\n \nFig. 4.3 Institutional setup in the water and sanitation sector (Sridhar 2012)\n\n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n57\n\n \n58\n\nA.A. Cronin et al.\n\nunder the SWSM (Fig. 4.2). WSSO provides software support to district and blocks\nin areas like water quality monitoring, surveillance, evaluation, behavioral change\nand capacity building activities. At the district level the District Water and Sanitation\nMission (DWSM) is constituted under the supervision and guidance of Zilla\nParishads. DWSM\u2019s role is to facilitate communities (at the PRI level) to plan,\nimplement, operate and manage schemes in their areas. Similar to the support units\nat state level, DWSM is also supported by District Support Unit (DSU) to fill in\ntechnical knowhow and capacity building (Fig. 4.2). Key Resource Centers (KRCs)\nprovide capacity building on key technical areas from State to District level.\nThe Block Panchayats plays an intermediary role between DWSM and village.\nIn 2010 Block Resource Centers (BRC) were introduced to augment support at the\nvillage level. BRCs provide continuous handholding to Gram Panchayats and village communities to achieve the goals that are set at the village level. Finally, at the\nlowest level Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSC) operate. As the\nentire system is decentralized, VWSCs should be independent units which make\ndecisions and plans according to their local context and requirements. The resource\nand financial requirements are fed into the institutional system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "faf0d70d-ac69-4950-9785-d3fe8c5fab16": {"__data__": {"id_": "faf0d70d-ac69-4950-9785-d3fe8c5fab16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb344d30-96f6-4b53-b459-a215d6a82a46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e21adf22442b2529c049521ebcc330be1cddb71bb7476a09087137fd82c15252"}, "3": {"node_id": "53f500b9-66b7-455f-8a1a-62455649ed95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "514b4f7d40d5e2782dc598134cc4a0ae973f3a6113e35a041a8f06017dbd59ba"}}, "hash": "2be274ff7e8c39684b48c6632519d6b84a48a6b45fc7c18add6d5739186c419d", "text": "The resource\nand financial requirements are fed into the institutional system.\nThe system then works to meet these requirements and focus efforts towards\nmeeting the goals set by the Centre, State, District and the Village, ideally in consultation with each other. Achieving adequate WASH coverage is not possible independently and requires convergence. This implies that the agencies responsible for\nplanning, design and implementation must act in consultation with each other and\nensure coordination at field level. As previously outlined, access to drinking water\nis determined by water availability and this issue spans several ministries. Water\nResources (surface and ground water) is governed by Ministry of Water Resources\n(MoWR). In rural areas, monitoring of ground water is undertaken by the Central\nGround Water Board (CGWB). Ground water is replenished by watershed development programs in some states and watershed development falls under Ministry of\nAgriculture and Cooperation\u2019s purview (MoAC). The Water Quality Assessment\nAuthority (WQAA) is the responsibility of Ministry of Environment and Forest\n(MoEF). These links imply that all these ministries have to be involved in the sustainable provision of drinking water. Several ministries besides MDWS, including\nMinistry of Health and Family Affairs and Ministry of Women and Child\nDevelopment, are required to achieve universal access to safe sanitation and ensure\ngood health via adoption of best hygiene practices.\n\n4.3.2\n\nUrban Institutional Structure\n\nUnlike rural water supply urban water supply does not have a clear organizational\nstructure. At the highest level, the responsibility of provisioning urban water supply\nand sanitation services rests with the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD).\nEnsuring these services for the urban poor is under the remit of the Ministry of\nUrban Employment and Poverty Alleviation. Other National Ministries that share\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n59\n\nthe responsibility and also contribute financially towards urban water and sanitation\nare Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, and Ministry of Home\nAffairs. Two other ministries that have a role to play in urban water and sanitation\nare Ministry of Water Resources which allocates resources to meet urban demand\nand Ministry of Environment and Forests, which also influences the decision on\nutilization of the resources used to meet urban needs.\nA coherent and comprehensive institutional structure to deliver water and sanitation services in urban areas is not evident, though the 74th Amendment of the Indian\nConstitution intended to empower Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to deliver basic services required in their regions. As a part of this, Central Finance Commission was\nset up through which finances are allocated to States to renew their urban localities\nespecially small and medium scale towns to contain migration to bigger cities.\nSimilarly, at the State level, State Finance Commission is advised by both\nCPHEEO and technical advisory boards in allocating funds to ULBs. Further down\nfrom this level to district and ULB, every state has its own structure to deliver services. In some states like Karnataka the State sets up engineering cells (Karnataka\nUrban Water and Sanitation and Drainage Board) to advise ULBS to plan their\nwater and sanitation services. Likewise, Tamil Nadu has Tamil Nadu Water Supply\nand Drainage Board that advises ULBs and also executes the services for them. In\nmunicipalities like Rajkot, the municipality takes up the responsibility to plan and\nimplement the water and sanitation services. With these examples it should be noted\nthat overall there is no single, uniform structure that is followed by all urban agglomerations countrywide.\nThe 74th Amendment mandates a structure where the State Finance Corporation\nprovides funds to urban agglomerations through Metropolitan Planning Committee\nand eventually to ULBs though it has been observed that this process is often not\nfollowed by the states (Planning Commission 2001).\n\n4.4\n4.4.1\n\nThe Current Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation\nScenario in India\nRural\n\nThe Joint Monitoring Programme or JMP (WHO/UNICEF 2012) estimates that 97\n% of urban areas and 90 % of rural areas in India have access to an improved source\nof water (Fig. 4.4). JMP defines an improved drinking-water source is one that by\nthe nature of its construction adequately protects the source from outside contamination, in particular with faecal matter. Indeed, the global MDG for drinking water\nhas been met thanks to the considerable contribution of India.\nHowever, access to improved drinking water quality does not take into account\nthe safety of the water supplied (Bain et al. 2012). Hence, this value of 92 % of the\npopulation accessing improved water is impacted upon when the issue of water\nquality is considered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53f500b9-66b7-455f-8a1a-62455649ed95": {"__data__": {"id_": "53f500b9-66b7-455f-8a1a-62455649ed95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "faf0d70d-ac69-4950-9785-d3fe8c5fab16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2be274ff7e8c39684b48c6632519d6b84a48a6b45fc7c18add6d5739186c419d"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4c518ef-219b-4bed-b59c-d95b7ea7dadb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cf08f852658a7fda3a7f429febff787bbda5068360b20cc0a86ed67dad4f20c"}}, "hash": "514b4f7d40d5e2782dc598134cc4a0ae973f3a6113e35a041a8f06017dbd59ba", "text": "Microbiological (principal health threats from bacteriological\n\n \n60\n\nA.A.

A UNICEF study conducted across 60 districts of\nIndia in 2007 found that from a total of 11,800 water sources tested 40 % were\nnon-compliant for bacteria testing parameters respectively (MDWS 2011a). Sanitary\nsurveillance, simple risk assessment forms filled out at water sources; indicate that\nthis comes, not surprisingly, from the high levels of open defecation and poor operation and maintenance. Fluoride has been detected across 188 Districts in 19 States\nand Arsenic across 54 Districts in 8 States (MDWS 2011b). Needless to say, the\nat-risk populations in both cases are in the millions.\nAnother key issue behind these statistics is that of who is gaining access\n(Mudgerikar and Cronin 2012). Sixty-five percent of the richest quintile of India\nhave piped water on premises while it is only 2 % of the poorest quintile; in rural\nareas 32 % of the richest quintile have piped water on premises while it is 1 % of the\npoorest quintile (NFHS-3 2006). Scheduled Tribe (ST) household access to piped\nwater is lower than the India average (24 % as opposed to 44 %); the corresponding\nvalue for Scheduled Castes (SCs) is 41 %. STs and SCs are also disproportionally\nwith lower access to sanitation than the Indian average (75 % and 63 % respectively\nas compared to the national average of 50 % from Census 2011)..In terms of sanitation, though progress has been made India will miss the MDG target (Fig. 4.5).\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n61\n\nFig. 4.5 Sanitation provision in India 1990\u20132010 (WHO/UNICEF 2012)\n\n4.4.2\n\nUrban\n\nIndia is rapidly urbanizing and now almost one third of the population lives in urban\nareas. Associated with the rise in urbanization, WASH access for the urban poor is\nan issue of concern. Although the 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012) considered the\ncensus slum population (42.6 million, 14.88 %), it is also mentioned in the document that \u2018almost 30\u201340 percent of India\u2019s urban population lives in slums\u2019 (Planning\nCommission 2008).\nWater supply is not uniform across all cities or states. The average per capita\nwater supply for Class I cities of Tamil Nadu is 79.9 l and for Maharashtra, it is\n310.09 l, whereas the average per capita per day water supply for Class II cities of\nthe state is 106.74 l. Among the Class II cities of Maharashtra, water supply ranges\nbetween 34.5 LCPD in Malkapur to 464.94 LCPD in Anjangaon. Such variations\nare common across all the cities and states of the country. One of the major reasons\nfor wide variation in per capita water supply is the poor management of the water\nsupply system. Levels of system losses through \u2018unaccounted-for water\u2019 or \u2018nonrevenue water\u2019 are often as high as 50 % in Indian cities and represent large financial\nand environmental losses to cities and their economies. A study of four cities of\nMadhya Pradesh revealed that this Non-Revenue Water (NRW) ranged between 31\n% and 49 % in Bhopal, between 37 % and 43 % in Jabalpur, and between 36 % and\n66 % in Gwalior; based on the study, city-specific water demand management strategies were developed to minimize water losses and to increase revenue for municipal corporations (UN-HABITAT 2006).\n\n \n62\n\nA.A.

Estimated sewage\ngeneration from Class II cities is about 2,697 MLD and the treatment capacity is\nonly 8 % of the generation. Thus, 70 % of untreated sewage from Class I cities and\n92 % from Class II cities contaminates surface and groundwater on a daily basis.\nLocation is the deciding factor for source and availability of drinking water. It is\nreported that 50.7 % of urban households have access to piped water supply at home\nbut access in non-slum and slum areas is 62.2 % and 18.5 % respectively.1 Further,\nthe disparity on the basis of tenure status is more severe and, generally, households\nof the non-notified slums are totally deprived from piped water supply in a dwelling\nunit (Fig. 4.6). The disparity in access to improved not shared (individual) toilet\nfacility between slum and non-slum households is clearly visible. Also clear is the\nurban\u2013rural sanitation divide, as well as social group disparities (Fig. 4.7).\nIn India, empirical observations indicate that there is a vicious cycle of relationship between the insecurity of housing tenure and access to basic services. Tenure\nsecurity is defined by housing conditions and employment status. In general, those\nliving in slums are considered as poor. But, among the slum dwellers, there is a\nhierarchy of tenure security. Basic services such as housing, water and sanitation,\nelectricity, education, health and above all employment and access to credit also\nplay a vital role in the overall development and enhancement of quality of life of the\npoor people living in slums. But, basic services, such as water and sanitation are not\navailable to the slum dwellers living in \u2018illegal\u2019 housing or what is called \u2018slums\nwith insecure land tenure\u2019. Hence, land tenure has a very significant link with access\nto basic services and therefore poor and most needy are left out of the formal systems of water supply (Darshini and Shah 2009).\n\nFig. 4.6 Status of piped\nwater supply and sanitary\nfacility for urban poor and\nnon-poor\n\nSanitary Facility\nUrban poor\nNon-poor\nOverall Urban\n\n1\n\n18.5\n\nPiped Water\n\n47.2\n62.2\n50.4\n\n95.9\n83.2\n\n\u2018Key Indicators for Urban Poor in India\u2019, available at http://www.uhrc.in/name-CmodsDownload-index-req-getit-lid-99.html (accessed 16 October 2011).\n\n \n63\n\n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\nFig. 4.7 Open defecation\nrates (%) across scheduled\ncaste (SC), scheduled tribe\n(ST) and the all-India\nnational average, analysed\nfrom Census (2011)\n\n100\n75\n\n80\n\nUrban\nRural\n\n82\n67\n\n60\n40\n\n26\n\n24\n\n13\n\n20\n0\nSC\n\n4.5\n\nST\n\nAll India\n\nChallenges in Ensuring \u2018Water for All\u2019\n\nThe previous section showed that the present framework for managing water has not\nyielded its desired policy outcomes in terms of supplying water to all and catering\nto the needs of the poor and marginalized. Approaches on water seem isolated and\nnot integrated. Responsibilities for service delivery have been shifting to local bodies \u2013 urban local bodies (ULBs) and Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). However,\nmost of the time, these local bodies are unable to manage due to paucity of manpower, and lack of awareness and understanding of planning a water resource development and management activity. In most states, institutions created for water\nmanagement at the community level are not accountable and therefore do not have\nany legal identity. They also lack capacity in merging multiple programs and\nschemes. The question therefore is this: What can be done to change the situation?\nIn this section we outline some of the challenges that need to be addressed in a\ncoordinated fashion to further the goal of supplying water for all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edafa5e6-b26e-4993-8824-82524247337c": {"__data__": {"id_": "edafa5e6-b26e-4993-8824-82524247337c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4c518ef-219b-4bed-b59c-d95b7ea7dadb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cf08f852658a7fda3a7f429febff787bbda5068360b20cc0a86ed67dad4f20c"}, "3": {"node_id": "305e5cad-7c59-40f8-a54a-b6bcd05bdf66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "903ad949b2d4172e7aa0c55f4b8cb1b29a715e36f86f2e2cd01c8892747b62a9"}}, "hash": "4d5f8a8618c5847c9787fcc2098dce95e681761922a2095a4382b92f9dce9fea", "text": "4.5.1\n\nEconomic Challenges\n\nIt is also imperative to take into account that people cope with declining water availability in a variety of ways. A recent study of the costs of coping with inadequate\nwater supply in Delhi found that the true total costs of water supply are already\n\u2018privatized\u2019; on average, the private coping costs are Rs 262 per month (when capital costs are included) versus a monthly water bill of only Rs 141 per month (Misra\n2005). Indeed, the provision of availing a consistent 24 \u00d7 7 supply to water at higher\ncost might not appeal to the elite group which already has ensured supplies by\nmeans of bore wells, water storage tanks or pumps. Managing this water scarcity\nsituation is an immense challenge due to the socio-economic set-up of the country.\nAnother study, a water balance study of municipal water supply conducted in four\ncities of Madhya Pradesh (UN-HABITAT 2006) suggests that the available water\nsupplies theoretically translate into per capita availabilities ranging between 150\nand 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd). But at the consumption end, the availability\n\n \n64\n\nA.A. Cronin et al.\n\nremains low, due to substantial non-revenue water which is estimated to range\namong cities between 28 % and 45 %. The study reveals that the present water supply problems can be attributed to lack of governance and inadequate monitoring\ninfrastructure rather than to scarcity of water resources. The financial and institutional assessments suggest that the reporting on revenue is inappropriate with poor\nestimates of collection efficiency, revenue and expenditure and over reliance on the\ngovernment for financial support.\nCompeting uses also reflects in the economic domain. A key player with ever\nincreasing water demands is industry. Industries are a large promoter of economic\ngrowth and as India strives to maintain and accelerate its impressive GDP growth,\nthe demand for water in the industrial sector is also bound to increase. India is the\ntenth most industrialized country in the world with about 88 industrial clusters scattered across the country (CPCB 2009). Water is an integral component in industrial\ninfrastructure and hence its importance in sustaining the GDP cannot be undermined. As mentioned before, the industrial sector accounts for only 2 % withdrawal\nof the total freshwater resources of the country. According to the projected water\ndemand for 2030, the demand from industry will quadruple to 196 BCM (13 %),\npushing overall demand growth close to 3 % per annum (Addams et al. 2009). An\nanalysis on water use in industry, making a case for the underestimation of water\nuse by the industries in India (CSE 2004) argues that water use efficiency in Indian\nindustries is significantly lower in comparison with other developing countries in\nthe world.\n\n4.5.2\n\nPolitical Challenges in Ensuring Water\nas a Human Right\n\nWater is an immensely political issue due to the nature of the resource. This resource\ninteracts with a highly inequitable society marked with class, caste and gender differentiation. Techno-managerial reforms in the water sector have been unable to\ntackle the fundamental issues of inequity in water supply.2 In this light, the right to\nwater issue becomes important. India is now a signatory to the 2010 United Nations\n(UN) declaration of water as a right. A rights-based approach to water means that\ncommunities have the opportunity to participate in decision making on water-related\nprojects and plans, and have access to information concerning water, such as safe\nhygiene practices and water quality data. Ensuring right to water means that the\nobligation to guarantee that everyone has access to safe clean water rests with\ngovernments.\n\n2\nPrakash and Sama (2006) document one such experience from Gujarat where water access is\nintertwined with caste and gender relationships. The authors observed \u2018that power structure and\nsocial and economic hierarchy go hand in hand and unless the issue of resource inequity is tackled\nthrough policy and advocacy means, the real issue will not be solved\u2019.\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n65\n\nAll stakeholders, especially the state, market, community and civil society, are\ncritical to resolving the challenges faced in the water supply landscape in India\ntoday. The prime role of the state is to formulate people-centric policies thus ensuring parity. Also, to bring in strong directives for those violate the existing laws and\nregulations. The market is seen by many as a profit-making entity that may compromise on the issue of equity and sustainability. Under strong state regulations, markets do play a positive role in water service delivery, research and development, and\nalso water-related technological solutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "305e5cad-7c59-40f8-a54a-b6bcd05bdf66": {"__data__": {"id_": "305e5cad-7c59-40f8-a54a-b6bcd05bdf66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "edafa5e6-b26e-4993-8824-82524247337c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d5f8a8618c5847c9787fcc2098dce95e681761922a2095a4382b92f9dce9fea"}, "3": {"node_id": "97313814-175a-4bee-a11a-0a6aea5c78e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3fb852bfb0c6830f9d28b0efe0bcc7bd62682073e67b500e6ae4aa0744b2502"}}, "hash": "903ad949b2d4172e7aa0c55f4b8cb1b29a715e36f86f2e2cd01c8892747b62a9", "text": "There is no single entity known as \u2018the\ncommunity\u2019 as it is divided by socio-economic class, caste, tribe, age, gender.\nModels exist for the community\u2019s self-regulation, which needs to be seen in an\noverall framework of people-centered development with more political and financial powers for the community to implement water-related projects. The role of civil\nsociety becomes important here as it helps community capacity building thus\nenabling community members to manage resources in a decentralized resource\nmanagement framework. Their role in having a close watch on the water management process is also important for equitable water distribution and sustainable management of the resource.\nCommunity involvement in a structured process is essential to achieve this, right\nfrom the planning to implementation level (for example Biswas 2012). However,\nthe problem is twofold; on one side, the authorities lack planning, and the community, too, is not actively getting involved in water supply projects. Wherever the\ngaps from both ends have been met, the water supply projects have been successful.\nOther related issues are gaps in technical capacity at the level of the resource, delivery, distribution and O&M, lack of information about the policies and plans, and\npolitical interference.\n\n4.5.3\n\nEnvironmental Challenge of Dealing with Water\nAvailability and Scarcity\n\nWith an estimated per capita availability of 1,588 cu m/capita/year (CWC 2010),\nIndia does not fall under the category of a water scarce country per se, rather it can\nbe termed as a country under \u2018water stress\u2019.3 However, India faces a large gap\nbetween current supply and projected demand, amounting to 50 % of demand or\n754 BCM (Addams et al. 2009). Any analysis pertaining to water resource management in India would be futile without incorporating the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of the resource. Erratic distribution of rainfall, results in to\nfloods and droughts in various areas of India. While theoretically it might be feasible\nto divert water resources from surplus to deficit regions, the ecological sustainability\n\n3\n\nAccording to the UN an area experiences water stress when annual water supplies drop below\n1,700 cubicmetres (cu m) per person. When annual water supplies drop below 1,000 cu m per\nperson, the population faces water scarcity, and below 500 cu m \u2018absolute scarcity\u2019.\n\n \n66\n\nA.A. Cronin et al.\n\nand affordability of such an exercise puts constraints on its implementation. Even in\nthe areas where water is made available it is important to revisit the sustainability of\nsuch supply by looking into service indicators and customer feedback rather than\nmere technical supply indicators. Further, climate change is now become one of the\ndevelopmental challenges for nations across the world. Climate change has an altogether different connotation for a country like India due to its varied topography,\nconsisting of diverse bio-geographical features including forests, coasts, mountains,\nmangroves, islands. Further, the dependence of people, especially the poor, on the\nnatural resource base also makes them more vulnerable to such changes. The Lower\nBhavani Project in Tamil Nadu, is a clear example, where the most significant\nuncertainty factor is rainfall variability (UNWATER 2012). This has led to water\nscarcity and a highly unpredictable situation for the farmers without canal supply to\nendure and adapt to seasonal fluctuations in water availability.\nWater pollution is adding to India\u2019s water woes with almost 70 % of surface\nwater and an increasing percentage of groundwater being contaminated by biological as well as chemical, organic, inorganic and toxic pollutants (MoWR 2000). The\nsources of such pollution include point sources such as industrial effluents and\ndomestic waste, and non-point sources such as agriculture. The health implications\nof poor water quality are enormous, and water and sanitation related diseases are\nresponsible for 60 % of the environmental health burden in India (Planning\nCommission 2008). Water quality is another major concern. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in drinking water is an extremely important parameter of\nwater quality given the crucial role water plays in healthy lives. The world over,\nunsafe drinking water, along with poor sanitation and hygiene, are the main contributors to an estimated four billion cases of diarrheal disease, causing more than\n1.5 million deaths, primarily among children under 5 years of age (WHO 2011).\nSurveys have estimated that over one third of rural ground water sources in India\nmay be microbiologically contaminated, much of this contamination is preventable\nand proper operation and maintenance of water sources coupled with safe sanitation\npractices (MDWS 2011a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97313814-175a-4bee-a11a-0a6aea5c78e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "97313814-175a-4bee-a11a-0a6aea5c78e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "305e5cad-7c59-40f8-a54a-b6bcd05bdf66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "903ad949b2d4172e7aa0c55f4b8cb1b29a715e36f86f2e2cd01c8892747b62a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "38b51ba6-c5be-4a17-80e7-6cbb28d5141b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "79128515e5b7b38a9dbe055287011cbabea51ae8b8f8f450a85f44e0448be26a"}}, "hash": "c3fb852bfb0c6830f9d28b0efe0bcc7bd62682073e67b500e6ae4aa0744b2502", "text": "Indeed, improving environmental sustainability of water\nand energy was been cited as one of the top ten interventions that India needs to\naccelerate growth, in order to reach its economic potential (Goldman Sachs 2008).\nAs is evident from the gap between sewage generation and sewage treatment capacities of major cities, there is an immediate need to build appropriate infrastructure.\nThere is legislation that addresses the prevention and control of pollution \u2013 for\nexample, the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act of 1974, Water Cess\nAct of 1977 (amended in 1988 as the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution\nCess Act), and the umbrella legislation, the Environment (Protection) Act or EPA\n(1986). Recently, the Right to Information (RTI) has also been used by activists and\npeople as a potent legislation to deal with discrepancies in the water sector. Although\nthe Indian government is working more proactively on the increasing threat of water\npollution, it will take very significant political will for these actions to translate into\nconcrete measures resulting in improved water quality.\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n4.5.4\n\n67\n\nThe Challenges of Equity and Distribution\nin Water Supply\n\nOne of the major constraints often cited for India in achieving developmental goals\nis the pressure of an ever-increasing population; it has now reached over 1.21 billion\n(Census 2011). The per capita water availability during this period has decreased\nfrom 2,309 cu m in 1991 (Sharma and Bharat 2009) to 1,588 cu m in 2001 (CWC\n2010). Considering the projected population growth in 2025, the per capita water\navailability can further decrease to under 1,000 cu m. Despite the National Water\nPolicy (NWP) assigning the highest priority to drinking water, providing adequate\nand safe drinking water to every household in the country remains an onerous task.\nA projected 40 % of the population will be living in the urban areas by 2030 with\nhigher purchasing power. This will increase calorie intake putting greater pressure\non existing water resources. There exists a huge disparity between the water consumption patterns of the rich and the poor.4 Access to water is governed by power\nrelations in society with the poor often being differentially excluded from this process. The efforts to augment water supply and \u2018manage the scarcity\u2019 often concentrate on the technical and managerial aspects thereby reinforcing existing\ninequalities. It is imperative to consider the relational aspect of water scarcity and\nthe differential consumption patterns as the scarcity experienced by a poor person\nwith reference to basic livelihood needs should not be clubbed with the luxury needs\nof the urban rich.\nProvision of water supply and sanitation for increased population in urban areas\nand provision of infrastructure in peri-urban areas are some of the challenges faced\nby the government. At the moment, the policies are either geared towards urban or\nrural areas with different institutional setup for delivery of services. The peri-urban\nareas in this case face greater challenge as they face the brunt of urbanization and\nlose their water security to fulfill increasing urban demand for 24 \u00d7 7 water. In many\nareas, tankers fetch water from peri-urban areas and supply them to urban domestic\nand industrial use. Prakash (2012) documents the case of Hyderabad where tanker\neconomy is thriving at the cost of peri-urban water security. Due to large influx of\npopulation mainly because of the expansion of the city as an Information Technology\n(IT) hub, the peri-urban areas have been losing out on water access to the more\npowerful urban population with high paying capacity. These areas are witnessing\nchange in two ways. First, they cater to the rising urban economic class that is ready\nto pay for constant water supply through the sale of water fueled by an informal\nwater tanker economy. Second, peri-urban areas and their citizens are at the receiving end of the waste water produced by cities, and suffer the consequences in the\nform of polluted rivers, industrial and domestic waste and a damaged urban ecosystem. This trend has led to immense water insecurities due to a combination of\n4\n\nA study by Water Aid in Delhi reveals that in one particular locality, \u201892 per cent of water supplied\ngoes to 20 per cent of population and the remaining 80 percent of population gets 8 per cent of the\ntotal piped water supply\u2019.

Rural and\nurban women of almost all age groups are engaged in collection of water for household needs, including water for livestock. Women balancing pots of water on their\nheads while travelling vast stretches is a common sight in rural India, as is the serpentine line of women standing in queues in urban slums to collect water from a\nsingle tap! Indeed, water collection is a responsibility that primarily rests on women.\nThe average distance travelled by women every single day in rural and peri-urban\nIndia has been a subject of countless surveys, and the fact that this indeed affects\ntheir overall health and decreases productive work hours is established in many\nresearch studies.5 The girl child\u2019s educational and overall self-development status\nsuffers a serious setback in a society where they are considered inferior to the male\nchild by getting involved in water collection and other household chores constrained\nby water supply. Although the policy discourse has recognised this role of women,\nit has not come without its own peril. Women\u2019s role in government water schemes\nhas largely been reduced to water collectors while undermining their potential for\ninvolving them in the decision-making process. As per the NRDWP guidelines, the\nmembers in VWSC should be selected to represent various groups of society and\n50 % of which should be women especially those belonging to SCs, STs and OBCs.\nThe efforts were made to involve more and more women in the programmes at a\npolicy level. However, in reality and on the ground, these provisions are hard to\nimplement because of strong gender bias. The technological interventions which do\nnot take into account the social, economic and familial constraints of a society with\nrespect to women, may lead to unfair outcomes for them.\n\n4.5.5\n\nInstitutional Issues\n\nIndia has a significant governance deficit when dealing with changing water scenarios. Severe water shortages have led to a growing number of conflicts between\nusers in the agricultural and industrial sectors, as also the domestic sector. The pressures and drivers that stem from demographic, socio-economic, industrialization\nand urbanization processes could have been better dealt with, if there as a sharp\nvision for governance of water. Governance of water is divided between the central\nand state authorities, with categorization of rules and responsibilities, yet it is seen\nthat the overall sustainable vision for water development, conservation and management remains missing. There is a dire need for convergence of laws and legislations;\nthere exist too many laws and this in turn dilutes the water issue. The coordination\nand synchronization between departments/implementers and regulators is fragmented leading to each department doing things without coordination with other\n5\n\nSee, for example, Seaforth (2001).\n\n \n4 Drinking Water Supply in India: Context and Prospects\n\n69\n\ndepartments, and sometime at cross purposes. The regulatory bodies have not been\nstrict in controlling, for example, appropriation of water bodies, industrial pollution.\nAlso, there is lack of data disaggregation and aggregation in important decision\nmaking by the body involved in water planning. Data is generated by different bodies and is sometimes contradictory in nature. The importance of data and its input\ninto management and regulation have been stressed for the 12th Five Year Plan\n(Shah 2013). Much stronger political will is equally essential in finding sustainable\nsolutions to water problems and reducing the current governance deficit in water\n(UNICEF, FAO and SaciWATERs 2013).\n\n4.6\n\nConclusions\n\nHere we have traced the sector development in India, both in urban and rural areas,\nand have outlined the issues currently holding back progress. India has had significant challenges to date in managing water. Emerging challenges such as climate\nchange are going to further transform the water management scenario rapidly. This\nchapter shows that the present framework for managing water has not yielded its\ndesired policy outcomes in terms of supplying water to all and catering to the needs\nof the poor and marginalized. Approaches on water seem isolated and not integrated. Responsibilities for service delivery have been shifting to local bodies \u2013\nurban local bodies or ULBs and PRIs. However, most of the time, these local bodies\nare unable to manage due to paucity of manpower, and lack of awareness and understanding of planning a water resource development and management activity. In\nmost states, institutions created for water management at the community level are\nnot accountable and therefore do not have any legal identity. They also lack capacity\nin merging multiple programmes and schemes. The question therefore is this: What\ncan be done to change the situation?

While there is some recognition of\nright to water in international human rights, as well as in the Indian constitution, at\nthe level of state legislation and policies in India, different dimensions of right to\nwater do not get much support. This is true even of cases like Maharashtra, where a\nparticular version of rights (for example, entitlement to water) has been put forward.\nIn addition, there has to be stronger disincentive for polluting the water source\nwhich accentuates the scarcity situation while polluting freshwater resources.

It gives an overview of different debates around women and environment and\nshows how these have shaped the discourse and practice around gender and water.\nThe chapter then goes on to discuss the reforms in the water sector at the global\nlevel and how this has impacted the discussions around gender and water. A comprehensive review of literature is done in the context of India which covers the various writings and actions in the area of gender and water. The review specifically\nlooks at gender and equity issues in the areas of rivers, dams and displacement,\nwater for production and domestic water.\nThe chapter argues for going beyond the politics of representation and developing new agendas and creative forms of engagement with people\u2019s movements- more\nspecifically women\u2019s movements, farmers movements and unions working on the\nquestion of growing informalisation of the economy, greater accumulation of capital, increasing injustices and disparities in everyday living- to see the linkages\nbetween land, water, rivers, natural resources and livelihoods.\nKeywords Ecofeminism \u2022 Gender \u2022 Domestic water \u2022 Water for production \u2022 Dams\nand displacement\n\n5.1\n\nThe Historical Context\n\nThe early 1970s witnessed a global environmental crisis with a model of limitless\ngrowth at the cost of nature. This was increasingly being challenged with questions\naround sustainable development raised by environmentalists the world over. Among\nthese were also strong feminist voices questioning the unsustainable paradigm\nwhere women and mother earth were exploited. Eco-feminist thought primarily\n\nS.

In the developing world however the context was different and a zero growth model could not be conceived of in the midst of poverty.\nEnvironments and their conservation had thus to be seen in the context of the millions who depended on nature for their survival.\nSubsequently a large body of literature developed around the theme of Women,\nenvironment and development both in the developed and developing world, primarily as a response to the crisis on nature and its people. Actions and writings around\nthese themes were a wakeup call for governments. The World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development (WCED), better known as the Brundtland commission was set up in 1983, which came out with the report \u201cOur Common Future\u201d\n(1987).

Since then there have\nbeen several summits and conventions on issues related to sustainable\ndevelopment.\nIn a sense 1992 can be considered as a marker for work around gender and water\nemerging globally. Its roots of course lay in the rich body of work coming as a\nresponse to environmental degradation, and the limitless growth in the first world\ncountries since the late 1970s and more so in the 1980s and 1990s. Deep Ecology,\nsocial ecology, ecofeminism (Merchant 1983; Salleh 1990, 1991; Mies 1986; Mies\nand Shiva 1993), political ecology (Blaikie 1985), feminist political ecology\n(Rocheleau et al. 1996), feminist environmentalism (Agarwal 1992) etc contributed\nsignificantly to literature and actions around gender and water.\nEcofeminist thinking however had a lasting impact on actions, programmes and\nwritings around gender and the environment. There is however no one single ecofeminism but several ecofeminisms broadly classified as cultural and social ecofeminism. Cultural ecofeminism has been critiqued for its biological determinism\nwhich sees a close and inherent association between nature and women. Since the\nsurvival of both is so intricately linked, women are seen as the nurturers and regenerators of nature. These positions drew heavy criticisms from social ecofeminists as\nwell as other feminists for essentialising both women and nature, for seeing them\nwithout the complex web of relations in which they are bound with each other and\nthe larger society. Social ecofeminists or feminist environmentalists understood the\nrelationship between women and the environment as based in a material relationship. Women\u2019s reproductive work of collecting fuel, fodder, water brings them in\nclose connection with the environment and hence their knowledge and experience\nbecomes crucial in the management and regeneration of nature. At a macro level the\nwork of Maria Mies (1986) is crucial as it looks at exploitation of nature, women\u2019s\nlabour and other subsistence workers from the developing world as a systematic\nprocess of entrenching new patriarchies and capitalist accumulation on a world\nscale (Mies 1986).\nWhat is important for us is how these debates informed the women and environment related actions and policies and vice versa. In the developing world contexts\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n75\n\nearly actions and writings on gender and environment were framed within the oil\ncrisis of the early 1970s, the increased dependence on wood fuel and women\u2019s\nburden in collecting wood fuel. Women were thus seen as victims of this degradation facing the brunt of degrading forests, depleting water resources. Large scale\nforestry programmes were planned to address this concern and by the 1980s there\nwas a realization that most of these had failed since there was no community participation; this understanding led to programmes being planned with communities participating in forestry management and community was understood as women\nbecause of their close relationship to nature. The widely acclaimed Chipko movement from India in a sense changed the discourse with women being projected as\nthe protectors of forests hugging trees to save them. This significantly contributed\nto the framing of women as the solutions to the problem of degrading environments\n(Shiva 1989). Thus from victims women were now being viewed as solutions to the\ncrisis. Guha\u2019s (1989) ethnographic work which traced the long history of the movement, its Gandhian tradition gave a different view to the Chipko movement by\npointing towards the shortcomings of an essentialist interpretation of Chipko which\nignored history.\nLearnings from this body of work led to formulations which tried to locate the\nenvironment and gender question within broader frameworks by addressing the\ndynamic and complex relationship of nature, and genders, diversity and development (Agarwal 1992; Green et al. 1998; Jackson 1993; Rocheleau et al. 1996). The\nbackdrop of this discussion is important for us to locate work around gender and\nwater which was largely informed by these debates.\n\n5.2\n\nGlobal Policy Changes in Water\n\nIn Dublin in Ireland in January 1992 the International conference on water and\nenvironment for the first time stressed the importance of women\u2019s participation in\nwater management. Strangely it was the same conference which also clearly laid the\nbasis for commoditization of water. All of the four principles1 were accepted and\nwere recommended to the countries across the globe at the Rio Earth Summit held\nlater in the same year. Participation through decentralised planning and management and cost recovery through pricing were considered as important measures in\nwater management in the post Dublin era.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c79ce86-a29d-4f0e-b908-c32bd5b8d290": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c79ce86-a29d-4f0e-b908-c32bd5b8d290", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6e02190-57c7-4c2c-9155-ee2e2ba9f056", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a91c570b215f45487c729bd0dd985a0225af8d1a545b2a8bd5738115fa5fe9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "f35af9f2-1fda-4fbb-b7d4-d7275f493507", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbf2f362af51dcb99a27285e9ea25e98c7ff017a9578b989ca8148576536f1ca"}}, "hash": "7935036fe795ae777b12e0f1887ddfea0671ecf892ad6566cbdedd053adccb6a", "text": "It also marked a clear shift from a\n1\n\nThe four principles Principle 1: Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain\nlife, development and the environment.\nPrinciple 2: Water development and management should be based on a participatory approach,\ninvolving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels.\nPrinciple 3: Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water.\nPrinciple 4: Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an\neconomic good.\n\n \n76\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\ntechnocentric approach to water management to one which recognized the need for\ninstitutional restructuring and economic reform. Following this were the World\nWater Forums since 1997. The first one was in Morocco, Marrakech in 1997 where\nthe main theme was to develop the \u201cVision for Water, Life and the Environment in\nthe 21st Century.\u201d It was in the second world water forum held in 2000 at the Hague\nthat gender issues got firmly entrenched with the formation of the Gender and Water\nAlliance or the GWA (genderwateralliance.org). International agencies acknowledged the need to involve men and women in planning for water (UNDP 2003). As\npart of the Global Water Partnership formed in 1996, country water partnerships\nwere set up in different countries and many in South Asia had Women and Water\nnetworks that emerged from the country partnerships. Much has happened since at\nthe global level in terms of recognizing water as a human rights issue on the one\nhand and commoditizing it on the other, however gender remains a stated but unaddressed cause. The rhetoric on gender will remain a distant dream unless it is located\nhistorically and understood as a set of complex relations between the different genders, defined identities and embedded in hegemonic power relations (cutting across\ncaste, class and race) that serve the interest of state, capital and patriarchy.\n\n5.3\n\nThe Gender and Water Literature: An Overview\n\nMuch of the documented work on gender and water emerges in the post Dublin\nperiod. A fall out of this was a spate of programmes designed to include women in\nwater management, largely at the micro level institutions planned around domestic\nwater. Most national and state governments brought in women\u2019s participation in\ntheir policy documents guided largely by agendas set by multilateral agencies.\nFeminist writings approached the question by highlighting the contradictions\nbetween recognizing women\u2019s contribution as significant on the one hand and turning water into an economic good on the other (Cleaver and Elson 1995; Green and\nBaden 1995; Zwarteveen 1998).\nFraming women as being connected closely with nature and thus as privileged\nknowers and placing undue burden of water management and conservation on\nwomen drew heavy criticism from feminists. These critiques brought out the instrumental approach to women\u2019s participation in water. They also pointed to flaws in\nunderstanding women and communities as homogenous without addressing the\nstructures (caste, class, race and other differences), identities and discourses that\ndetermine access to water (Ahmed 2005; Joshi and Fawcett 2005; Kulkarni et al.\n2007; Rocheleau et al. 1996).They called for a more nuanced approach to understanding gender and water, locating it in the larger political ecology framework. In\na nutshell then, we have literature that supports the essentialist view of women\u2019s\nclose association with nature and hence water and that which counters this view by\nsaying there is nothing inherent and essential in the association. Within the realm of\nthese debates policy makers and to a great extent uncritical practitioners continue to\nunderstand women as instruments to address the water crisis, especially at the micro\nlevel.\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n77\n\nIt is indeed a difficult task to take complete stock of gender and water issues in\nthe Indian context in one article here. The first challenge is to organize the multifarious and overlapping writings on this topic in any compartments. But a broad categorization that seems useful for this particular review looks at writings and work\naround (a) rivers, dams and displacement (b) domestic water and (c) water for production. Again these are not mutually exclusive categories but would help us unravel\nthe different meanings around water and its relation to gender. We already have two\ngood books, namely, \u2018Flowing Upstream\u2019, edited by Sara Ahmed (2005) and the\nmore recent one \u2018Diverting the Flow\u2019 edited by Zwarteveen et al.

Rather than going into an elucidation of this work here I would like the water\nreaders to refer to some basic writings on gender and patriarchy in the Indian context (Geetha 2002; Chakravarti 2006; Menon 2012; Mohanty 2004; Ghosh 2009)\nthat show that gender is a social construct that intersects with other hegemonic\nstructures like caste, class, race etc to create unequal power relations which greatly\ndisadvantage women especially so from disadvantaged social groups. It is an organising principle that creates identities which determine how we are perceived and\nexpected to think and act. Gender relations are thus social relations between the\ndifferent genders that reflect the distribution of power. They also determine the work\nwe do and the work that gets valued or not. Productive work is considered as valued\nwork, which creates surpluses and is largely done by men it is believed while reproductive work is largely unpaid work that is significant from the point of view of\nsubsistence and welfare of the household. Much of this work is done by women and\nis not recognized as work and less still as work that contributes to accumulation of\ncapital. These images, symbols and meanings around gender and gender relations\nget firmly entrenched and carried forward through institutions like family, marriage,\nstate, religion and markets for example. With this as a historical context we can now\nsee how and why gender mainstreaming in water is not only about changing water\npolicies but about bringing about a paradigmatic change in our understanding of\nwater and gender.\n\n5.4\n\nRivers, Dams and Displacement\n\nRivers have several meanings in India; they are the source of life and livelihood and\nhave a strong religious and cultural meaning in people\u2019s lives. In the Indian context\nreference to rivers has often been as female. Feldhaus (1995) points out how waters\nin rivers are attributed with feminine properties in folk as well as classical material\nin rural Maharashtra as elsewhere in India. She points to not only the purifying\n\n \n78\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\npowers of the rivers but also their fertilizing properties. Her work discusses the\nfolklore around rivers in Maharashtra, which she shows is linked to different goddesses of fertility and fecundity. They depict the different cycles of life i.e birth,\ngrowth and death. Feldhaus gives several references from the Vedas that refer to\nriver in the feminine and describe the beauty, benevolence and the rage of the river.\nLahiri Dutt\u2019s work also discusses through an ethnographic work on the Bengal\ndeltaic rivers how the images around rivers in these regions are constructed as feminine with qualities such as benevolence, nourishing and yet at the same time fearsome and frightening (Lahiri-Dutt 2006). She further goes on to show how natures\nare constructed within ideological frameworks and the construction of feminine\nrivers also reflects the gender relations within society that encompass love, hate and\nfear of women. Lahiri\u2019s work brings out the close relationship between the symbolism associated with nature and with women. She argues how this is used to the\ndisadvantage of subaltern groups in this case women, as an \u201canchoring platform\u201d to\nreproduce inequalities.\nShiva\u2019s work for example in Staying Alive (1989) points out how irrigation\ndevelopment, or damming rivers, to be more specific \u201cviolates cycles of life in rivers.\u201d and leads to drought and women\u2019s exploitation.

Literature has also\nshown how new formalized institutions in fact have a male character to them.\nInterestingly women are at the forefront of these struggles, but do not seem to benefit very much from them in terms of addressing gender inequities. These struggles\nhowever display the strong urge of women to change the course of dominant understandings around development (Mehta 2009; Lahiri-Dutt 2012). The Narmada\nmovement and the lesser known movements in South Maharashtra are testimony to\nthis. These are struggles against dispossession from land and water and the livelihood rights of people. But they also raise questions about the change that these\nprojects bring about in their lives in terms of the social and cultural meanings that\nthe rivers held for them.\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n5.5\n\n79\n\nDomestic Water: Female Domain\n\nDocumented examples of water for domestic use abound in the literature around\ngender and water. Several of these documented examples are also from regions\nwhere there have been stronger NGOs or organisations working on women, SHGs\nand rural livelihood issues. Women\u2019s collectivisation around water for domestic use\nstems from their role as providers of household care. Thus lack of water for drinking\nand domestic use implies hardships for women in performing their role as providers\nof care and nurture. We therefore find several examples where women have come\ntogether and responded to crisis of domestic water in very creative ways, either\nthrough engagement with the state, or through acquiring new skills in water harvesting, conservation, repair and maintenance and management. There are also examples of how women\u2019s collectives have through participatory processes resolved the\nwater crisis of their villages. It may not be possible here to take stock of all the\nexamples around drinking and domestic water, simply because there are a large\nnumber of such examples both documented and undocumented. For example noted\nsocialist leader from Mumbai, Mrunal Gore was fondly remembered as Paniwali bai\nor water lady because she led several struggles for water, price rise and basic amenities in urban slums, and women were in the forefront of these struggles. As early as\n1968 she fought for the right for water and other civic amenities for slum dwellers\nin Mumbai (Gavankar 2003). Numerous such tales abound in history where women\nhave collectivised for water, largely to reduce their burdens of going through hardships to collect scarce water from long distances. Women\u2019s struggles around domestic water need to be understood in the context of the established system of division\nof labour where women\u2019s work includes domestic work of caring, cleaning, fetching\nwater, fuel, fodder, cooking etc. or what is often referred to as reproductive labour\nin feminist work. In fact gender and water often gets equated with women and\ndomestic water largely neglecting women\u2019s work with productive water. For example women\u2019s extensive labour in different stages of irrigated agriculture or use of\nwater for tanning and other village industries hardly gets accounted as work related\nto water. Feminists have critiqued this division of water domains where domestic is\nconsidered as the female domain and productive water as the male. The established\ndivision of labour extends to the water sector as much as to any other dimension of\nwork (Zwarteveen 1995, 1998; Kulkarni et al. 2007). Productive water involves\ncommodity production, marketing and cash exchanges thereby giving an economic\nvalue to water, whereas domestic water remains as a consumption resource with no\nevident economic value. Feminists have pointed out that it is in fact these \u2018domestic\u2019\ntasks of women that contribute to surplus generation and capital accumulation.\nHowever this analysis has not been systematically applied in the context of water.\nSome of the well documented and visible examples of work around gender and\nwater are those initiated by well established NGOs and organisations, such as\nUtthan, SEWA and Tarun Bharat Sangh to name a few.\nIn the Bhal region of Gujarat which has scanty rainfall and saline groundwater,\nwomen under the banner of Utthan formed a coalition called Mahiti and demanded\nsolutions for clean and adequate water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e31956a8-e837-4e89-9660-eced7f871d1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e31956a8-e837-4e89-9660-eced7f871d1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0cad1f0-c6a6-4780-b02e-b81dbdebbf9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "177d91c51856c2912a8e360138411d6a5fbff9dd56694c2dd82aae912ccd396e"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a5e0573-9d94-4c51-aa38-7311da576a2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2d69ee7c71bad090a7385181e76f6d66b747e1ce5c20f5f1ea8b8163abc074f"}}, "hash": "0314c9e609bfa31784b28e133ca2c8e9d179ab186366ecaa5986682b9e2cd722", "text": "The Gujarat water supply board thus agreed\n\n \n80\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\nto approving a project to promote decentralised rain water harvesting structures,\nsuch as plastic lined ponds, roof top water collection tanks and similar such local\nsolutions to address the water problem (utthangujarat.org, accessed 11 june 2013).\nSewa trained its women members in hand pump repairs so that they are equipped to\ndeal with problems that arise due to failure of hand pumps. These trained women\nnot only work as barefoot water technicians but in turn have also trained several\nwomen to deal with similar crises (Iyenger 2000; Ahmed 2000).\nTarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) in Rajasthan has been working for more than two\ndecades now on revival of traditional water structures in Rajasthan and the idea of\nwater parliaments has been a much acclaimed one. Increasingly TBS is engaging\nwith women through the establishment of Mahila Jal Biradaris which is a village\nlevel collective that identifies the key reasons for the crisis and also looks for possible solutions for addressing it. Documented reports show that such processes have\ncontributed to addressing water scarcity and reducing the drudgery of women (Field\nwork discussions with TBS staff 2010).\nIn 2007 with a severe drought affecting the Bundelkhad region a local group\nParmarth mobilised rural dalit women through its informal initiatives of pani panchayat and jal sahelis with the aim of conserving traditional water bodies and preparing water conservation plans for some of the districts in this region. For dalit\nwomen to come forward and challenge the caste ridden society, this was indeed a\nchallenge. With a network of 2000 women across 60 gram panchayats in three districts of Bundelkhand they have not only addressed the water question but importantly also challenged the caste and patriarchal order of society and established right\nto water as a human right (Singh 2012).\nThese and many more examples from the rural context occurred in the post\n1990s, which coincided with the Dublin principles of course, but also with increasing scarcity and mismanagement of water due to the extractive and iniquitous policies of the early 1970s especially with relation to ground water. All of these examples\nchallenged the mainstream thinking around women and water. Utthan\u2019s experiment\nis important from the point of view of women\u2019s collectives being able to counter the\nconventional wisdom of the water departments to invest in large centralised pipeline\nprojects which have not necessarily found answers to certain kinds of local problems such as this one. Both SEWA and TBS examples become important as they\nchallenge the static understanding around gender roles as providers of care and\nnurture. While in SEWA women take on the role of technicians, which is otherwise\nconsidered as a male domain, in TBS women analyse, think together and find solutions again understood to be a male trait and prerogative. In both cases women take\non new roles, challenge stereotypes and yet continue performing their old tasks as\nwell. New work simply gets added on. How do we understand these examples- as\nusing women as solutions to the problem and burdening them or as an opportunity\nto discuss the age old feminist question of division of labour. Unfortunately most\ngender and water interventions stop at the solution and do not use the space provided to challenge gender roles and division of labour thereby burdening the already\noverburdened women. Much of the gender and water work as we can see remains\nisolated from feminist politics despite the challenges it posed to water paradigm as\nwell as to gender stereotypes.\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n5.6\n\n81\n\nWater for Production: The Male Domain\n\nIn the post 1980s reforms were being brought into public sector irrigation across the\nglobe. Poor uptake of irrigation, failure of the governments to maintain and sustain\nirrigation systems both physically and financially were some of the evident triggers\nfor this reform. Thus transferring irrigation management popularly known as\nIrrigation Management Transfer (IMT) and transferring operation and maintenance\nto the farmers, were the key elements of the irrigation reform process.\nGender was not on the radar of irrigation thinking since its objectives were\nclearly geared towards sustainable management of the systems and the increased\nefficiency of irrigation and crop productivity. Women were not considered as users\nand farmers were typically male. Thus in the initial years one finds little writing and\nthinking on gender and irrigation. Some of the early assessments of the IMT programmes were done by IWMI (then IIMI) Colombo which clearly showed that IMT\nwas a mixed bag of experiences.

These writings pointed to the\ncommoditization of water and a gradual erosion of water rights especially for\nwomen (Zwarteveen 1997, 1998; Kulkarni et al. 2008). However there were also\ncautionary articles pointing to the need to not ignore the agency of women and men\nin these changing contexts. Jackson (1998) argues the need to look at the subjectivities of women and their embodied livelihoods to understand the ways in which\nwomen relate to water (Jackson 1998).\nSome of the early writings on role of women in irrigation also came from IWMI\u2019s\ngender group and it highlighted both the role of women in irrigation and also the\nimpact of IMT on female farmers. These studies showed that a water user is not a\nneutral homogenous category, but there are differences between male and female\nwater users since roles in farming are different. The authors thus argued that the\nimpacts of IMT vary significantly across different groups of users (Zwarteveen and\nNeupane 1996).\nDespite these differences women were not identified as farmers and were\nexcluded from farmer organizations. Their interests were thus marginalized and this\nexclusion, the studies concluded, is constraining and may have serious impacts on\nwomen\u2019s well being (Merrey 1997).\nResearches done in different parts of Africa and Asia also showed similar findings in terms of women\u2019s exclusion from irrigation planning, in some cases these\nexclusions were related to ownership of land and in others simply because of a lack\nof formalized policies of inclusion of women in different for a to allow for better\nallocation of irrigated lands (van Koppen 1998). Extensive researches were done to\nidentify and typify women farmers across different regions of the globe and provide\na tool base for assessment of indicators for improvement of gender performance\n(van Koppen 2002).\n\n \n82\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\nIn the Indian context IMT was largely known by the name of Participatory\nIrrigation Management. Although there are historical evidences of community managed irrigation systems that can be traced to centuries ago the formal idea is as\nrecent as the twentieth century. In fact Maharashtra and Gujarat had formed water\nusers associations as early as the 1930s. Although there was little response then, the\nPIM movement in India geared up towards the late 1980s with the first formal Water\nUsers Association being formed in Maharashtra, in Ahmednagar district on one\nminor canal of the Mula Major Irrigation Project in 1989 (SOPPECOM 2004).\nSince then there has been leapfrogging in India with several states by the end of\n2012 making PIM mandatory (Shah 2011).\nLiterature in the context of gender and irrigation is very sparse in the Indian\ncontext. Broadly it can be classified as literature that came from (a) critical understanding of irrigation as a modernizing project, increasing undue burdens of the\nlaboring classes and (b) from experiences gained through including women in the\nPIM process.\nCritical writings on irrigation and women\u2019s role came in the late 1980s and early\n1990s. As mentioned earlier Shiva\u2019s writings brought out the destructive powers of\nirrigation through the damming of rivers- on both rivers and women. Agarwal and\nothers have contested these views but in a different way shown how irrigated agriculture in fact hinges on the availability of cheap female labour thereby leading to\ntheir exploitation. In her study she showed how among the Garo tribes irrigation led\nto privatization of land and subsequent displacement of women from critical role in\nagriculture (Agarwal 1994). Agarwal and Shiva essentially show how development\nof irrigation in fact commoditised agriculture and displaced women from subsistence agriculture. This was also lucidly brought out by Ramamurthy in her study of\nWUAs in Andhra Pradesh where she shows how irrigation as a modernizing strategy has led to increased agricultural productivity and surpluses and in the process\naltered the sexual division of labour, workloads and labour processes of women\nacross castes and classes to the disadvantage of women (Ramamurthy 1991). Studies\nin Maharashtra have also shown how irrigation, resultant sugarcane cultivation has\nled to intensified alcoholism amongst men and subsequently increased violence\nagainst women (Seshu and Bhosale 1990).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6304c581-b661-4ab6-8c06-3158d729918d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6304c581-b661-4ab6-8c06-3158d729918d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a5e0573-9d94-4c51-aa38-7311da576a2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2d69ee7c71bad090a7385181e76f6d66b747e1ce5c20f5f1ea8b8163abc074f"}, "3": {"node_id": "434a4579-411f-4ad8-9418-1dede34cbf4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f50914674b536bc3b2f05a70c7517c5e8652456846f9cfefd6000d2f034e8011"}}, "hash": "5efca5816b5ecae4d6c88e90238dd5a208e51293f91ddc57e48ce96b8eefa0b2", "text": "The other set of writings around gender and water in irrigation come from groups\nworking in the public irrigation sector. This was partly as a response to donor agendas which in turn were also largely influenced by critical work around gender and\nwater. Much of this work was within the framework of providing women with facilities that are directly related to their current roles of cleaning, cooking, washing etc.\nThus bathing steps in canals or clearly demarcated spaces for washing and cleaning\nwere some of the policy and programmatic prescriptions in the context of gender\nand irrigation (Shah 2002). This work pointed out that women\u2019s priority concerns\nand needs are around domestic water i.e. cooking, bathing washing i.e around the\nreproductive needs and not so much around the productive needs despite the fact\nthat they were served by the canal.

Women are simply an add on. It also comes from disciplinary\nunderstandings that seldom challenge the existing social order. So neither are the\ngoals of irrigation seen beyond efficiency and nor are women seen beyond their role\nof nurture and care for the household. The same organizations that set out with these\nunderstandings of irrigation and women also changed their objectives over time\nwith exchange of new perspectives and ideas. A significant example in this regard is\nthat of Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) in Gujarat which has been\nworking on PIM extensively. Recognising that canals were used for multiple purposes such as washing, bathing, livestock and of course irrigation, the organisation\ndecided to rethink canal management. They introduced women\u2019s nominal membership to the WUA committees irrespective of ownership to land in commands.\nWomen were thus recognised as users of water. AKRSP fought against the rules of\nthe Irrigation department and brought women onto committees. The experience has\nbeen positive and AKRSP has documented the change this action has brought about\nin women in terms of their active interest in management activities, participation in\nagriculture and farming related trainings, but above all the confidence in dealing\nwith Irrigation officials and talking to them of their problems (Vasavada 2005).\nHowever around the same time or a little earlier there were writings in India\nlooking at lift irrigation schemes and women\u2019s participation in it from a feminist\nperspective. These writings looked at empowerment and changing gender relations\nas a result of irrigation and related interventions (Ahmed 1999). Sadguru foundation\nworking in tribal areas of Gujarat in its lift irrigation interventions involved women\nin decision making. Despite the restrictive rules of the government in terms of\nincluding women in the executive committee of the lift co-operatives, Sadguru went\nahead and formed the committees with nominal membership of women. Later in\n1996 the law was amended to include three women on the executive committee of\nthe Lift Irrigation co-operative. According to Sara Ahmed\u2019s study of three lift cooperatives of Sadguru, women\u2019s lives have changed substantially. In her study she\nbrings out the positive impact of women\u2019s participation in the scheme and the role\nthey played in resolving conflicts related to water sharing and water rotation. She\nhas also documented changes in women\u2019s self perception, confidence and importantly mapped the changes in gender roles that were brought out so vividly after\nSadguru\u2019s participatory exercise to map changes in sexual division of labour.\nIn Jharkhand with support from Professional Assistance for Development Action\n(PRADAN) an innovative programme around women\u2019s participation in Community\nmanaged lift irrigation schemes (CMLI) was initiated.

When managed by the men\nfarmers, WUAs it was reported were not effective as water charges were not being\ncollected, and maintenance was not being done apart from several other problems in\nrunning the scheme effectively. When Pradan decided to finally close down these\nschemes, they thought of using the rich SHG experience with women and asked\n\n \n84\n\nS.

Shramik Mukti Dal (SMD), a left thinking group articulated this in the form of\nright to assured water for livelihoods at an affordable cost. SMD worked out through\nintensive field based experiments the quantum of water that a household of five\nwould require annually in a drought prone region. The demand was also expressed\nin terms of a per capita requirement to ensure that women are not excluded from this\nright in a household context irrespective of landholding. In principle thus SMD\nincluded the rights of women and landless in the context of water. The operationalisation of this right was of course a far more complex matter. Thus when the organization after a long struggle against the sand mafia planned and implemented its first\npeople\u2019s dam- Baliraja, it ensured sharing of water rights not only on a household\nbasis but made separate allocations within the household for women. This was\nexemplary and radical and addressed the gender question in the broader framework\nof societal change and gender justice. A few experiments were initiated on a few\nplots where one tenth of an acre was carved out for women and they began cultivating it using some of the water allocated as a household resource. This initiative\nneeded a concerted effort for it to see its fuller development (Joy and Paranjape\n2005).\nIn Karnataka the example of women\u2019s collectivisation in Kolar district of\nKarnataka where rural women were organised since the mid 1980s by Grama Vikas\nis significant. Kolar district has about 4500 traditional tanks which were constructed\nand managed under royal patronage. Most of these tanks were filled with silt and\nwere no longer able to fulfil the water requirements of the communities living in the\narea. Women spoke about this to Gram Vikas and thus Grameen Mahila Okkuta\n(rural women\u2019s collective) was formed. With a strong mobilisation they were able\nto pressurise the government to repair and desilt these traditional tanks which then\nbecame a significant source of water (Joy and Paranjape 2005).\nNGO efforts in involving women in decision making in PIM were seen across the\ncountry through the 1990s. In Orissa PIM was introduced in the mid nineties through\na state level policy. Thereafter formation of water users associations (WUAs) and\ntransferring of management of irrigation to these WUAs became a targetted programme of the Irrigation department. In the initial stages there were no special\nefforts made to involve women in these WUAs. Aunli command of Angul district\nwas one of the early experiments in irrigation to involve women in planning and\ndecision making (Dalwai undated). This was possible because interestingly 67 % of\nwomen owned land in this canal command. Men had not responded to the governments call to form a WUA, but women saw the potential and collectivized to form\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n85\n\nthe WUA and an all women\u2019s executive committee that took and implemented key\ndecisions. This example is very important and marks a milestone in the history of\nwomen and irrigation in India (cited in Joy and Paranjape 2005).\nFollowing on this in the mid 1990s a different kind of an experiment was initiated in Khudawadi village of Osmanabad district of Maharashtra. On a medium\nirrigation project of this drought prone region a WUA was formed on one minor\ncanal of the Kurnur Medium Irrigation project with the initiative of\nSOPPECOM. Frustrated with their experience with the Irrigation department for\nmore than 20 years since the completion of the irrigation project, farmers in\nKhudawadi responded to SOPPECOM\u2019s initiative of forming a WUA and entering\ninto an agreement with the department. In this case however the farmers at the\nbehest of SOPPEOM also added a new component of extending equity beyond the\ncommand area by including landless women as beneficiaries of irrigation water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "665a1623-ef3a-402a-86c1-ff3f31640881": {"__data__": {"id_": "665a1623-ef3a-402a-86c1-ff3f31640881", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "434a4579-411f-4ad8-9418-1dede34cbf4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f50914674b536bc3b2f05a70c7517c5e8652456846f9cfefd6000d2f034e8011"}, "3": {"node_id": "65e2847f-34bb-4f03-834d-a15a78b88982", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51aceedc3832e157a6750e665504b166b10f7160bbedc24e8cf29cd21167f586"}}, "hash": "7ad0ea47020b9cb39f4a95769155c370a5e9a6d6d483f406e1508008724bafbc", "text": "The\nWUA thus agreed to a 15 % share of their water quota for landless women to use\nwater outside the command areas. Lands were thus leased in by the women\u2019s collectives; storage ponds were constructed to lift the canal water and use it on the leased\nlands to grow fodder and fuel and some food.2 In several ways this action countered\nthe conventional thinking that irrigation is male and that it is limited to canal command (Kulkarni 2005).\nEfforts on expanding the notion of equity in the irrigation sector continued and\nthis is reflected in the writings in the post 2002 period. Stronger critiques of irrigation policies and programmes from a feminist perspective were gradually emerging\non the gender water scenario in India (Kulkarni 2005; Kulkarni et al. 2007; Vasavada\n2005). These critiques were also informing programmes and policy issues in the\nirrigation sector. They challenged the notion that women\u2019s realm is restricted to the\ndomestic and the productive is for the men. These alternative frameworks have\nraised considerable questions regarding the conventional and instrumental roles\nexpected of women in the water sector.\nAll of these examples where diverse groups of women stood up in a primarily\nmale domain are noteworthy. Examples from Orissa, Jharkhand, Gujarat and\nKarnataka, indicate women\u2019s overriding considerations for survival and livelihoods\nand hence the need to take on challenges that men do not. These experiences do\nempower them and create some spaces to negotiate power within the households as\nwas evident from the work in Sadguru. However, to conclude that water intervention\nalone led to these changes would be rather presumptuous. Examples from\nMaharashtra aim to change the discourses around water and gender. The SMD\nexample particularly is making an effort to address the issue beyond water by looking at structures, identities and also the mainstream discourses around both water\nand society.\nTwo significant findings emerged from these early experiences (1) women play a\nsignificant role in irrigated agriculture and (2) despite this they are excluded from\n\n2\n\nDetails of how the negotiations were worked out can be found in Looking back \u2026 in flowing\nupstream.\n\n \n86\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\nformally or informally being represented in water users associations and involved in\nplanning and decision making.\nThese findings helped in policy advocacy and mainstreaming some of these ideas\nin the field. It also led to stronger advocacy to define women as a category worthy\nof notice in irrigation and the need to bring them in decision making committees of\nthe WUAs (Kulkarni 2005; Vasavada 2005).\nPIM legislations brought in the recent years did introduce some changes in its\ngovernance structures. With the introduction of quotas in the managing committees\nfor women and in some states3 joint membership of men and women from land\nholding families within command areas have at least legally created a space for\nwomen in irrigation. The potential is large and some efforts are being made to use\nthis space in Maharashtra and elsewhere. However, women\u2019s lack of participation in\nirrigation goes beyond the hitherto lack of legal or formal spaces. It goes back to the\nconstruction of irrigation as a male activity and the farmer as a male entity. It overlooks the labour of women in both the reproductive and productive terrains which\ncontribute towards household survival.\nWhile formal representation was being seen as an important demand by gender\nwater advocates different studies since the late 1990s also showed how formal representation does not necessarily bring women into active decision making (MeinzenDick and Zwarteveen 1998); (Kulkarni 2011). In 1997 Ruth and Margreet\u2019s study\non women and irrigation in the context of South Asia shows that despite some of the\nformal spaces granted in policies women are rarely able to use these spaces due to\nthe iniquitous structures. As recently as in 2011, a study done by SOPPECOM,\nUtthan and TISS on decentralization, gender and water, points to women\u2019s lack of\nparticipation in decision making especially in the irrigation sector. It shows that\ndespite formal representation women are simply not able to participate effectively\nas a result of past histories of patriarchy and caste (Kulkarni 2011; Kulkarni and Joy\n2012).\nIn irrigation, of course formal representation remained limited to women who\nown lands in the command areas of these irrigation projects. Participatory Irrigation\nManagement laws restrict membership of WUAs to owners or holders of land within\nthe command areas of canals.

Thus in general the demand for recognising women\nas farmers and with a legitimate right to assured water has not been acknowledged\nby policy makers.\nRight to water for production often becomes a tricky issue in the context of water\nfor women especially because it is so closely linked with access to land. Studies\naround landownership have shown that not more than 11\u201312 % women own land\n(Agarwal 1994). Secondly mobilising women for water rights which are largely\nusufruct rights is complex as women are divided across social groups such as that of\n\n3\n\nMadhya Pradesh PIM Act includes spouses of landowners and holders to become members.\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n87\n\ncaste, class, religion and across households. Identities around social groups and\nhouseholds are stronger, especially when it comes to livelihood resources.\nAs we can see much of the research and practice in the area of gender and irrigation has largely focused on making women visible through documenting gendered\nwork patterns, which provides a case for improving their rights over water use and\ntheir representation in water related institutions like the water users association.\nWhile this body of work has been very useful in establishing a case for women and\nrecognizing them as stakeholders in the sector, it has neglected some of the central\nissues of critiquing irrigation, its association with men and technocracy and the\nresultant exclusion of the weak or the powerless. Presence of women in water management is not only about ensuring that they enter the predefined formal spaces in\nirrigation decision making, but also how these pre-defined boundaries of thinking\nand practice can change. A comparison between both the sectors has shown us how\nthe drawing of these boundaries has in fact served to maintain and strengthen the\nexisting gender hierarchies and identities that foreclose options for change, how\npolicy and programmatic changes are also constrained by the imagery and belief\nsystems that surround irrigation thinking. As recent literature (see Zwarteveen 2008\nfor example) points out, exploring this relationship is perhaps what lies at the heart\nof understanding the power relations within the sector.\nThis has also led to developing another aspect of gender and water which focuses\non men, masculinities and water (Zwarteveen 2008). This body of work looks at the\nassociation between masculinity and professional water performance and brings out\nhow power and politics in water appear as self evident, static and gender neutral. It\nthus argues for the need for going beyond representation of women to critically\nlooking at the nature of water knowledges. An initial exploratory study in the Indian\ncontext in this regard was done in the field of women as water professionals. This\nstudy done by SOPPECOM at the behest of SaciWATERs (SOPPECOM 2009)\nlooked at mainly women engineers and other managerial level women professionals\nworking in the water sector mainly with government departments across South\nAsia. The study clearly brought out the low numbers of women professionals in\nwater bureaucracy and this linked to their understanding of water as a technocentric\nand masculine subject. It was also evident from the way water priorities were set\n(emphasis on infrastructure over participation), work allocations were decided (site\nwork for men and desk work for women or financial and design planning for men\nand the administrative work for women) and of course infrastructure was available\n(no toilets and child care facilities in offices for example). Such studies would help\nunpack the gender question in the context of water in a qualitatively different way\nby understanding irrigation as a masculine and hegemonic discipline that constrains\nparticipation of women and other discriminated groups. The focus would then be to\nrethinking irrigation and revisiting our ideas around different genders, castes, class\nand power dynamics within and among them.\n\n \n88\n\n5.7\n\nS. Kulkarni\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nWhile grassroots initiatives related to gender and water have responded to everyday\ncrises related to water and social injustice, policies to address gender equity in the\nwater sector have often been in an awkward relationship with the ground realities\nwhere gender and other forms of social discrimination pervade all aspects of life.\nThey are simply not able to capture the social barriers that cause unequal access to\nwater and an undemocratic decision making process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb182d05-1144-4b0a-a5ac-c0fd5a74ea33": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb182d05-1144-4b0a-a5ac-c0fd5a74ea33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "65e2847f-34bb-4f03-834d-a15a78b88982", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51aceedc3832e157a6750e665504b166b10f7160bbedc24e8cf29cd21167f586"}, "3": {"node_id": "d812aacf-deb6-4145-a3da-bfe8777df135", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "915c85593205b02f7a4f6bdd4e4f5a106774ba6886a1c0af6473d141e8a2beb7"}}, "hash": "a4559f26806b0e90f27f0c229c1149d07da7efb43eb98b8e3535eb6602e6ec37", "text": "A considered approach to gender or caste question in water would call for a critical analysis of the constraints imposed on women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to resources\nby social structures, the gendered divisions of labour and a water paradigm that\nbrings in new reallocations and altered social and labour relations which firmly\nentrench new forms of discrimination.\nLearnings from over two decades of work around this question urge us to give\nfresh insights to the question. While a social justice agenda that brings in representation of women and socially disadvantaged groups in decision making and access\nto basic livelihood water would be an important policy measure, there is a need to\ngo beyond this policy rhetoric and address several other stakeholders through engaging them in creative ways of addressing inequities in water.\nThat there is a need to restructure both the water sector as well as our understanding of what constitutes the notion of women and gender relations has been stated on\nseveral forums. Policy suggestions based on this understanding have seen the inclusion of women and other socially disadvantaged groups in water institutions but has\nnot improved their access to the resource (SOPPECOM 2002).\nSo while policy advocacy within water remains an important area of intervention, it\u2019s time that new agendas and creative forms of engagement are available for\npeople\u2019s movements- more specifically women\u2019s movements, farmers movements\nand unions working on the question of growing informalisation of the economy,\ngreater accumulation of capital increasing injustices and disparities in everyday living- to see the linkages between land, water, rivers, natural resources and livelihoods. There is a need to cut across sectoral understandings around natural resources\nsince they are being appropriated by capital with active connivance of the state to\nthe disadvantage of the socially and economically discriminated groups. There is a\nneed to bring in interdisciplinarity in research and activism. It might be worthwhile\nfor example to explore how (a) reallocations of water are modifying tenure, labour\nand consumption relations and identities, in particular focusing on caste, class and\ngender divisions and identities; (b) identifying new possibilities and proposals for\ninfluencing water decision making and water activism to arrive at forms of water\nallocation that are fair \u2013 in terms of how incomes and benefits as well as costs and\nrisks are shared among different (groups of) people at different and across scales \u2013\nand sustainable.\n\n \n5 Gender and Water in India: A Review\n\n89\n\nReferences\nAgarwal, B.

It is characterized by arm\u2019s length regulation, achieved\nby creation of Independent Regulatory Agency (IRA). The diffusion and transplantation of IRA models, from developed country context into a developing country\ncontext, is a critical juncture for analyzing the emergence of regulatory state in\ndeveloping country. This paper reviews the debate generated in India when such\ntransplantation began in a politically sensitive and ecologically complex sector like\nwater. This is done by placing the local debate in the wider international discourse\non IRA.\nThe review shows how different mechanisms of institutional isomorphism \u2013\ncoercive isomorphism, mimetic isomorphism, and policy learning \u2013 can be used to\nexplain the structure and substance of regulation being adopted in India. Reforms\nthrough isomorphism raise concerns on the appropriate rationale for IRA in water\nsector. Review of the related laws suggests that the conventional credible commitment rationale is inadequate to explain the emergence of these IRAs. Political\nuncertainty, the root-cause of credible commitment rationale, needs to be explored\nas an appropriate rationale for IRA for ensuring development and implementation\nof long-term, integrated and consistent policy framework on water resources. But\nthis requires proper sequencing of reforms in which the evolution of normative\nframework precedes creation of new institutions like IRA. The paper further reviews\nthe normative aspects, such as equity and efficiency, to show how reconciling of\nseemingly contrasting principles is a huge challenge in developing an effective regulatory model. Finally the paper presents the idea of \u2018decentered regulation\u2019 and\n\u2018sunshine commission\u2019 as the two alternative propositions relevant for the developing country context.\nKeywords Water regulation \u2022 Independent regulatory agency \u2022 Institutional transplantation \u2022 Regulatory state \u2022 Developing country\n\nS.

The proposal for\nestablishment of such Water Regulatory Authorities (hereafter referred to as WRA)\nat the state-level has its origin in the reform agenda driven by international financial\ninstitutions such as the World Bank (Warghade and Wagle 2014). Now it has become\nan internal reform agenda of the Central Government. For example, the 12th Five\nYear Plan of India includes a section on WRAs and it also proposes a model bill for\nadoption by the states. The 13th Finance Commission also earmarked a grant which\nthe states could avail on the condition that they would establish a WRA. The process\nbegan with the establishment of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory\nAuthority (hereafter referred as MWRRA) in 2005. The MWRRA Act became a\nmodel for adoption by other states. Apart from the State of Maharashtra, such regulatory authorities have been established in other States such as Arunachal Pradesh\n(2006), Uttar Pradesh (2008/2014), Andhra Pradesh (2010), Jammu and Kashmir\n(2010), Rajasthan (2012), and Madhya Pradesh (2013).1\nAn IRA is a statutory body empowered to undertake important regulatory functions. Various regulatory functions, such as determination of water tariff, are delegated to IRA. Most important characteristics feature of an IRA is that it serves as an\narm\u2019s length body. Autonomy is accorded to the regulator, though in varying\ndegrees, to carry-out the functions independent of their political principals. A typical IRA comprises members who are experts in the respective field. Members are\nnot officers serving in the government but may have worked for government in the\npast. It is often a quasi-judicial body with powers equivalent to the civil court. The\norders of such an authority are legally enforceable. The State Electricity Regulatory\nCommissions in India or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India are typical\nexamples of an IRA.\n1\n\nFollowing laws have been passed till date for establishment of IRA at state-level: The Maharashtra\nWater Resources Regulatory Authority Act 2005, The Arunachal Pradesh Water Resources\nRegulatory Authority Act 2006, The Uttar Pradesh Water Management and Regulatory Commission\nAct 2014 (the Act of 2008 was revoked and replaced by the Act of 2014), Andhra Pradesh Water\nResources Regulatory Commission Act 2010, The Jammu and Kashmir Water Resources\nRegulation and Management Act 2010, The Rajasthan Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act,\n2012 The Madhya Pradesh Jal Viniyaman Adhiniyam (Water Regulation Act) 2013.\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n95\n\nThe WRAs established in India are representative of the typical IRA. For example, they are constituted by members having expertise in water engineering or water\neconomy. The MWRRA, which is the longest functioning WRA in India, is empowered to make autonomous decisions on water tariff and other regulation issues mentioned in the law. WRAs in other states have generally followed the model laid\ndown by MWRRA with some state-specific variations. For example, the WRA in\nUttar Pradesh has to recommend a cess on beneficiaries of flood control measures\nundertaken by the government. The WRA in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh\nhave been assigned advisory role. In their current form, they resemble the \u2018advisory\nregulator\u2019, which is seen as a transitional model of regulation before moving towards\nan IRA model (Brown et al. 2006, p. 99). But the overall direction to move towards\neconomic efficiency through independent regulation is evident from these different\nstate-level regulatory laws.\nThere is a wider discourse in the international literature on IRA as a component\nof regulatory reforms. There is a need to understand this discourse in relation to the\ndebate that the WRA has generated in India. This paper presents a review of this\ndebate by placing it in the context of the international discourse on IRAs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32a2bb5a-d274-4e41-b7f1-7180969b1d9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "32a2bb5a-d274-4e41-b7f1-7180969b1d9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0d490e9-7bd4-4a46-a331-e0fae5aa11bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e61d1a9d6228a34efd7a7b8b365b20c81c1f5444c1c11ec5722a3c4b4591fa9c"}, "3": {"node_id": "efed32fc-8f47-4467-bd99-44b386ccb81f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "923aa5aa08e2bd3a84871a64cde4438c977b5d00fdb1cb5bdb7dac2f1bd440d3"}}, "hash": "ea65e158675d8196c7b3264fa1cfd5f913d5494f28dd3ce0173c649b06919231", "text": "6.2\n\nThe Rise of Regulatory State\n\nThe development of WRAs can be understood in greater depth by locating the phenomena in the context of the rise of \u2018regulatory state\u2019 (Majone 1994, 1997; Moran\n2002; Minogue and Carino 2006; Dubash and Morgan 2013). Regulation has\nemerged as the central mode of governance in developed countries. In the context of\nEurope, the transition from the interventionist and welfare-oriented governance to\npredominantly regulation-oriented governance is characterized as the rise of \u2018regulatory state\u2019 (Majone 1997). This is seen as the outcome of coming together of\nimportant processes, viz., privatization of public sectors, deregulation of business\nactivities, and regulation by arms-length bodies such as the \u2018independent regulatory\nagency\u2019 (IRA). This transition to regulatory state is now taking place in developing\ncountries, although with its own characteristic features (Minogue and Carino 2006;\nDubash and Morgan 2013). Hence, the debate around the WRAs in India needs to\nbe located within this larger discourse on the regulatory state.\nDelegation to an IRA is one of the characteristic features of the regulatory state.\nThese IRAs are often categorized as non-majoritarian institutions of the government that posses specialized public authority. Members of an IRA are neither\ndirectly elected by the people, nor directly controlled by elected officials (Thatcher\nand Sweet Stone 2002). This is the ultimate step in delegation in a representative\ndemocratic set-up and hence becomes a very crucial and often controversial feature\nof the regulatory state (Gilardi 2001).\nThe WRAs being established in India represent this particular form of institutional reforms. Their spread in India can be viewed as part of the phenomena of\ndiffusion of IRAs in different sectors and in different countries. The IRA as a\n\n \n96\n\nS. Warghade\n\nregulatory model was first established in USA and later spread to Europe. Studies\nsuggest that the majority of the diffusion in UK and Europe started in 1980s coinciding with the Thatcher era of privatization. A comprehensive dataset has been\ndeveloped on diffusion of IRAs in Western Europe, Latin America and other OECD\ncountries (Jordana et al. 2011; Gilardi 2008). Although there is no concrete data-set,\nthere are references to diffusion of IRA models in Asia and Africa (Estache and\nGoicoechea 2005, pp. 138\u2013150). Starting mainly from financial sector (banking,\nsecurities, insurance), the IRA model has spread to utility (electricity, water, telecom, gas), general competition and also to social sector (food safety, work safety,\nhealth, pension, environment).\nIn India, the diffusion of the IRA model is happening across different sectors and\ndifferent states. Starting from the financial sector (like the Reserve Bank of India)\nthe IRA model is now adopted in various sectors such as electricity (the Central and\nState Electricity Regulatory Commissions), telecom (the Telecom Regulatory\nAuthority of India), and general competition (Competition Commission of India).\nThe state-level WRAs, that are being set up in India, are the new additions to this\nexisting list of IRAs. This could be seen as the beginning of the rise of the regulatory state in water sector. This signals a dramatic shift in Indian water policy and\ngovernance.\n\n6.3\n\nInstitutional Transplantation\n\nScholars identify \u2018institutional transplantation\u2019 of the regulatory models as one of\nthe key features of the regulatory state in developing countries (Minogue and Carino\n2006; Dubash and Morgan 2012; Dubash and Morgan 2013). The mechanisms of\ntransplantation or diffusion will provide valuable insights into the nature of regulatory reforms in water sector.\nThe diffusion mechanisms have been studied by scholars of institutional theories\n(Peters 1999; Gilardi 2004). An important component of this is the theory of sociological isomorphism, which asks the question of why a similar form of institution\nemerges in absolutely different political or social context (Peters 1999). For example, why relatively similar forms of regulatory authorities, such as IRA, emerge\nacross the developed and developing countries in financial, utility and other sectors\nincluding water? This is a relevant question considering that the WRAs have similarities with IRAs in electricity and other sectors in India. Also the water regulatory\nmodel that emerged in different states in India is relatively similar to the model first\nestablished in Maharashtra. The institutional theory explains this in terms of various\nmechanism of diffusion or isomorphism. The two mechanisms relevant to our case\nare: coercive isomorphism and mimetic isomorphism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efed32fc-8f47-4467-bd99-44b386ccb81f": {"__data__": {"id_": "efed32fc-8f47-4467-bd99-44b386ccb81f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "32a2bb5a-d274-4e41-b7f1-7180969b1d9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea65e158675d8196c7b3264fa1cfd5f913d5494f28dd3ce0173c649b06919231"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d2b5293-9038-470e-b1cb-b658c6a41b7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38c3fd095881e638d50358146486a96138f92993ae4271f0831b443af6f93823"}}, "hash": "923aa5aa08e2bd3a84871a64cde4438c977b5d00fdb1cb5bdb7dac2f1bd440d3", "text": "Coercive isomorphism is due to the pressure exerted from other organizations on\nwhich the policy makers or government are dependent for various reasons. In the\ncurrent water case, it is clear that the Maharashtra model of WRA has its genesis in\nthe World Bank supported project in which the funding was provided under the\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n97\n\ncovenant of establishment of IRA. Similarly the conditional grant provided by the\nCentral Government under the 13th Finance Commission acts as an external pressure on the states to adopt the regulatory model. Considering the fiscal constraints\nat the state-level, on raising funds for development and management of water\nresources, these external pressures on the government to adopt IRA models in return\nfor funds leads to coercive isomorphism.\nApart from the coercive forms, there are evidences of mimetic forms of diffusion\nin case of WRA. In mimetic isomorphism there is a tendency to mimic or imitate\nmodels from other places in belief that they represent the \u2018best practices\u2019 model.\nThis is seen in case of MWRRA, which is considered as model for replication by\nother states. For example, the law for establishment of WRA in Arunachal Pradesh\nis a ditto copy of the MWRRA Act.\nOne of the variant of the coercive and mimetic isomorphism is the mechanism of\ndiffusion through \u2018policy learning\u2019 (Peters 1999). Here it is assumed that the organizations would learn from the experiences of others and will adapt the models as\nper the suitability to the local context. There are evidences showing that the\nMWRRA law was accepted after a deliberative process conducted in the form of\nconsultations and scrutiny by legislative committee (Warghade 2013). There have\nbeen some changes in the model after this consultative process. Most importantly,\n\u2018equity\u2019 emerged as an important principle in the MWRRA Act. For example, the\nlaw accepts \u2018equity\u2019 as the principle for determination of water allocation and entitlements. This is in contrast to the principle of \u2018efficiency\u2019 that forms the key consideration in establishment of an IRA. The integration of equity related considerations\nin the otherwise efficiency-focused regulatory model can be seen as the outcome of\nthe \u2018policy learning\u2019 rather than coercive or mimetic diffusion. However, the law\nalso provides for creation of water markets, seen as a necessary institutional reform\nfor ensuring efficient water allocation. Water markets as the mechanism of efficient\nwater allocation is modeled around similar mechanisms existing in countries like\nAustralia and Chile. So although the incorporation of equity principle can be seen\nas a process of policy learning the transplantation of market-based model for water\nallocation can be seen as the outcome of coercive isomorphism.\nThe influence of the mechanism of \u2018policy learning\u2019 is found to be limited to the\nsubstantive values that guide the functioning of the regulator, such as the incorporation of principle of equity. The overall structural features of the IRA, such as the\nreliance on apex-level arm\u2019s length regulatory bodies, still continues as the key feature of the water regulatory model. Hence, the debate around WRAs can be categorized into the \u2018structural features\u2019, i.e., the organizational structure related to\nautonomy, and the \u2018substantive values\u2019, i.e., the principles that will guide the functioning of the regulatory.2 From the earlier discussion, it is found that mode of diffusion through policy learning is influential for determining the substantive values,\n2\n\nIn the regulatory literature, the \u2018structural features\u2019 mentioned here is termed as \u2018regulatory governance\u2019 (Brown et al. 2006; Levy and Spiller 1994) and the \u2018substantive values\u2019 is termed as\n\u2018regulatory substance\u2019 (Brown et al. 2006) or \u2018regulatory incentives or content\u2019 (Levy and Spiller\n1994).\n\n \n98\n\nS. Warghade\n\nwhile the structural features of the IRA are largely influenced by the coercive and\nmimetic mechanism of diffusion.\nThe combination of these diffusion mechanisms will lead to confusion.

The\nrationale for an IRA in water sector in India is highly debated among scholars and\ncivil society actors (Prayas 2007; Warghade and Wagle 2013).\nOne of the important structural features of the IRA is that powers are delegated\nto it without direct political control. So it becomes important to dwell on the question of the rationale for delegating powers to an IRA. There exists a detailed discussion in the international literature on the functional rationale for delegation to such\nautonomous bodies (Thatcher and Stone Sweet 2002; Gilardi 2001, 2004, 2008;\nLevy and Spiller 1994). One of the key arguments is related to the characteristics of\nnatural monopoly, seen in network-based utilities such as water and electricity. Due\nto the economies of scale it is beneficial to have a single service provider in such\nsectors. But this might lead to monopolist behavior by the service provider. Hence,\nthe government intervenes through regulation of various aspects of services such as\ntariff, quality, and access. If government regulates by itself the private investors fear\nthat political uncertainty due to electoral and other compulsions might erode their\ninvestments and future returns. In this situation, delegation to an independent, apolitical, and expert-based organization increases the credibility of the commitment\ngiven by political representatives to the private investors. Thus, \u2018credible commitment\u2019 rationale is most prominent in situation of privatization of natural monopoly\nsectors.\n\n3\n\nUsing the terminology of \u2018regulatory governance\u2019 and \u2018regulatory substance/ content\u2019 as used by\nLevy and Spiller (1994), and Brown et al. (2006).\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n99\n\nIn response to this, the scholars in India have argued that, in absence of largescale privatization of water utilities there is no case for an independent regulation in\nwater. Although water has the characteristics of natural monopoly, it is a resource\ndistinct from electricity and other such utility services. Hence, even the case for\nprivatization in water sector needs to be first developed and established before\naccepting an independent regulatory model. Privatization should not be taken for\ngranted considering the unique features of water as a life-sustaining and ecological\nresource (Prayas 2007).\nThis brings to light the problem of sequencing of policy and institutional reforms\nin relation to creation of an IRA. The question is whether the substantive policy\nframework precedes the creation of institutional form for giving effect to that policy.\nOne of the distinctive feature of regulatory reforms in developing countries is the\nincomplete or absence of privatization in different sectors (Minogue and Carino\n2006). In contrast to the post-privatization regulatory reforms seen in developed\ncountries, the regulatory reforms in developing countries, like creation of IRA, go\nin tandem with the efforts to privatize the sectors. Hence, the institutional form (like\nIRA) is created without an adequate discussion and debate on the policy decision to\nprivatize the sector. This aspect related to sequencing and timing of reforms has\ncreated confusion related to the purpose and design of the regulatory. For example,\nthe Electricity Act of 2003 was a package comprising both the provision for allowing private sector investments and provisions for regulation by an IRA. This makes\nthe regulatory model of IRA as controversial as the privatization proposal. The\nproblem with this is that the rationale for IRA cannot be discussed irrespective of\nthe privatization policy. This limits the scope of discussion on the alternative forms\nof regulation and rationale for IRA in a non-privatization scenario. Even in completely privatized sector like electricity, the IRAs are found to be regulating mainly\nthe state owned utilities because of absence of large-scale privatization. Hence, the\ndebate around the rationale for IRA needs to be widened beyond the privatization\nparadigm.\nA closer look into the legislations related to WRAs provides evidence of this\nnon-privatization scenario of regulation. Unlike the Electricity Act, the WRA laws\nshun away from clearly providing for private sector participation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8d74489-3df1-4279-97b2-a21c183e1b75": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8d74489-3df1-4279-97b2-a21c183e1b75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d2b5293-9038-470e-b1cb-b658c6a41b7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38c3fd095881e638d50358146486a96138f92993ae4271f0831b443af6f93823"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0962fa6-5218-4ef9-89b9-ad357aa0c20f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "705a67d4441f1e63b4fa2c0a88b2838931b98bd005c0ec9d063693571addd8c9"}}, "hash": "3fa7071b527eda7bc47b9a47d3ce60a89773d76eb2d6cab69f7440aa0a344f64", "text": "The first WRA\nlaw in India, the MWRRA Act, in fact negates any such possibility even in future by\nlimiting the level of cost recovery from tariff to operation and maintenance cost.\nRecovery of capital cost or fair returns on investment through water tariff is not a\npossibility as per the existing provisions of the MWRRA Act. But at the same time,\nthe WRA law in Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh includes a provision for\nlicensing of water service providers without actually mentioning the word \u2018private\u2019\nservice providers. This shows the reluctance to clearly incorporate the privatization\nagenda in the IRA laws and instead find out means to create spaces for privatization\nin future. Scholars have argued that the WRAs in India seem to be the thin end of\nthe wedge of privatization (Prayas 2007).\nIt is important to note that, although the WRA laws shun away from incorporating the reforms for utility privatization there are several urban water service projects\nundertaken for utility privatization.

The government\ndepartment promoting the privatization was reluctant to bring the proposal under\nthe regulator\u2019s purview. It was only after a petition filed against the process of privatization that the regulator finally issued an order for regulation of some aspects of\nthis privatization projects.4\nOverall it is found that neither \u2018regulation of privatization\u2019 nor \u2018regulation for\nprivatization\u2019 seems to be the articulated rationale for WRAs in India. The ongoing\nprivatization initiatives in water sector are emerging as cases of \u2018unregulated privatization\u2019 even after creation of IRAs. This is emerging as one of the key features of\nthe regulatory reforms in water sector in India. This is also not a hybrid model\nwhere the privatization process is regulated by a contract that is overseen by an\nIRA.5\nIf privatization is not on the current agenda of creation of IRAs, the question of\nthe rationale for IRAs in water sector gets more complicated. One of the alternative\nrationales is to overcome the \u2018political uncertainty\u2019 in policy areas requiring longterm vision and consistency (Warghade and Wagle 2013). The political uncertainty\narises due to the possibility of undue political intervention in the broader policy\ndirection and in the functioning of the state-owned utility. Uncertainty looms over\nthe continuity of the policies adopted by policy makers after change in the ruling\ngovernment. Partisan politics and politics of patronage are some of the factors that\ncontribute to the uncertainty. Various compulsions of electoral politics are at the\ncore of such political uncertainty.\nOvercoming such political uncertainty could be one of the important rationales\nfor creation of IRA in water sector, especially for evolving and implementing longterm policy framework. Change in government might lead to change in water policies with the effect of absence of long-term, integrated, and consistent approach to\npolicy and its implementation. Delegating such policy functions to an IRA, which\nworks irrespective of the political functionaries, could be seen as a counter measure\nto inconsistent and random changes in policy. Once the long-term vision and policy\nframework is laid down through political and legislative route then the independent\nregulatory could play an important role by distancing itself from the political and\nexecutive wing of the government and focusing on bringing consistency and continuity in policy implementation. So the \u2018credible commitment\u2019 rationale, which was\nfound highly relevant for protecting private investors, is important for the sole reason of protecting public interest associated with achieving consistency in the\nevolved long-term policy direction. However, this again is associated with the issue\nof sequencing of policy and regulatory reforms. It is expected that the policy framework in form of the substantive principles is laid down before the choice of the regulatory institution is made.\n4\n\nRefer Case 1 of 2008 before MWRRA.

It is observed that there is no framework of guiding\nprinciples in the existing water laws in India (Iyer 2009). Hence, developing such a\nframework is important before deciding on the appropriate institutional structure\nsuch as an independent regulator. It is in this context, that the recently drafted\n\u2018National Water Framework Law\u2019 becomes an important instrument that would provide the required normative principles for regulating water sector.6 While the process of enacting this national framework law is still in its nascent stage, there are\nimportant insights to be gained by looking at the substantive principles that the\nwater regulatory laws and their implementation have espoused.\nThe WRA laws throw open the important debate around \u2018equity Vs efficiency\u2019.\nAlthough the water regulatory laws do not clearly provide for privatization of water\nservices there are adequate evidences to show that genesis of the regulatory model\nlies in the economic efficiency rationale (World Bank 2005). There are two contributing principles found in the WRA laws in this respect. First is the \u2018cost recovery\u2019\nprinciple and other is the \u2018efficient water allocation\u2019 principle.\n\n6.5.1\n\nCost Recovery Principle\n\nCost recovery through water tariff has not been an important issue on the agenda of\nthe policy makers in India. Water supply has been highly subsidized. Water charges\nare largely determined based on political considerations rather than financial considerations. There was no legally mandatory provision for cost recovery. The WRA\nlaws in India for the first time are trying to institutionalize this principle by empowering the regulator to determine tariff based on cost recovery. For example, the\nMWRRA is empowered to determine tariff based on recovery of cost of operations\nand maintenance.\nExperience of electricity regulation in India clearly shows that once the regulatory is delegated powers in this regard, tariff setting is undertaken periodically as a\nroutine procedure. Even after political interventions in the form of providing subsidies, the routine tariff determination process has led to gradual and consistent\nincrease in the average electricity tariff. A similar process will be established in the\nwater sector once the regulators begin the periodic tariff setting process. Even if\nWRA laws currently cap the recovery level to operations and maintenance costs,\n\n6\n\nThe draft law was produced by a group, constituted under the 12th Five Year Plan process, and\nheaded by Prof. Ramaswamy R Iyer http://www.planningcommission.nic.in/aboutus/committee/\nwrkgrp12/wr/wg_wtr_frame.pdf.\n\n \n102\n\nS. Warghade\n\nwith the IRA law in Jammu and Kashmir adding cost of project, there is clear indication that tariff setting will become a routine and periodic process with higher\nchances of gradual and consistent increase in water tariff. How the objectives of\nequity and efficiency are addressed in such cases becomes highly important.\nThe experience of implementation of first such tariff regulatory process in\nMaharashtra, initiated in 2007, has thrown light on several dimensions of the equity\nand efficiency debate (Prayas 2013). Reduction of cross-subsidy in terms of higher\ntariff charged to industrial water users as against other sectors, mainly agriculture,\nis seen as an important regulatory policy for enhancing the efficiency of the sector.\nIn this process initiated by MWRRA, the initial attempts of reduction of crosssubsidy were highly objected to by water users during the regulatory consultations.\nThe active participation and concrete demands made by agriculture and domestic\nwater users resulted into a highly \u2018social tariff system\u2019 in Maharashtra. Affordability\nand other social considerations have been accepted in the tariff formula along with\nconcessions accorded to various disadvantaged groups like tribal communities,\nproject affected people, small and marginal farmers, rural water users and others.\nThis shows how an independent regulatory process, when conducted in participatory manner, has the potential to tilt the debate towards equity. As the crosssubsidizers, mainly the industrial water users, start participating in the process the\ndemand for efficiency will also gradually come into the debate and there will be an\nopportunity to reflect and arrive at the right balance of both the principles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d31efc08-c3c2-4f50-b69b-e0f56efa50b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d31efc08-c3c2-4f50-b69b-e0f56efa50b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0962fa6-5218-4ef9-89b9-ad357aa0c20f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "705a67d4441f1e63b4fa2c0a88b2838931b98bd005c0ec9d063693571addd8c9"}, "3": {"node_id": "c30c3f62-48e7-4e5d-99e9-137403eaf4df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba341da4a8c6726ca552f6f8d1ec994e25d7ea86670dae73588fad5a2f33d508"}}, "hash": "b4d4980ed3b30d9d47de02f7c8b39faa40a4fb538e88b4e602f99951e0c461d7", "text": "6.5.2\n\nEfficient Water Allocation\n\nIn contrast to the experience in water tariff, the regulatory process around water\nallocation in Maharashtra suggests a very different picture. As per the principal law\nthe MWRRA is empowered to determine water allocation. Through this legislation,\nthe political functionaries accorded powers to the regulator to determine allocations\nbased on the principle of equity. But the same political functionaries were found to\nbe bypassing the powers of the regulator by reallocating water from agriculture to\nindustrial use without due cognizance of the MWRRA Act. The principle of equity,\nas provided in the law, was not followed while making these reallocation decisions.\nWhen farmer groups and civil society organizations opposed the reallocation and\ndemanded adherence to the equity principle as given in the regulatory law, the political functionaries amended the law with the effect of revoking the equity principle\nand also the related powers of the regulator (Wagle et al. 2012).\nData shows that huge amount of water was reallocated by the political functionaries to several industrial projects such as Special Economic Zones and private\npower plants. In light of increasing water demands from urban-industrial sector and\nthe dwindling potential for increasing water availability, allocation of water will be\nan important function in future that provides opportunity of wielding political clout\nand power. The delegation of water allocation powers to an IRA seems to be a threat\nperceived by the political functionaries. Thus, an IRA, that provided opportunity of\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n103\n\npublic participation in case of tariff determination, is not seen as an acceptable form\nof institutional mechanism by the policy makers in case of a highly politicized issue\nsuch as water allocation.\nIt should be noted that the economic efficiency principle, that drives regulatory\nreforms, puts lot of emphasis on reallocation of water from lower to higher economic benefits. Hence, reallocation of water from agriculture to industrial use, done\nby the political functionaries, goes well with this economic principle. But it raises\nquestions of due process and of consideration to equitable allocation of resources.\nThe reallocation process in Maharashtra was a closed-door political decision making instead and not transparent regulatory process as expected in the MWRRA Act.\nAccording to the market principle accepted in the MWRRA Act, the process of\nwater reallocation was expected to be made operational through a system of tradable water entitlements. In such water market, the water entitlement holders can\nengage in voluntary transactions with non-entitlement holders in return of an acceptable compensation. But before any such entitlement system could be established or\nmarket could operate, huge amount of water is being reallocated through the political route without any consideration of the rights of the farmers. Any proposal for\nwater market, in such a situation, will accentuate inequities in water allocation created through this inadvertent and non-transparent political route of reallocations. It\nwill also accentuate inequities created in the past when landless and others disadvantaged sections were devoid of right to the water stored in the dams.\nThis discussion on water tariff and water allocation throws light on the complications associated with operationalizing regulatory principles. One of the central\ndebates is around the question of reconciling equity and efficiency. It also throws\nlight on the political power-play that will influence the regulatory space. Dubash\nand Morgan rightly suggest that the intensity of redistributive politics will shape the\nscope and nature of regulatory state in the developing countries (Dubash and\nMorgan 2013). Unless these dimensions of the existing regulatory space in a developing country are adequately understood and assimilated in the regulatory design\nthe IRA models of regulation will remain ineffective.\n\n6.6\n\nDepoliticization through Expertocratic Regulatory\nProcess\n\nThe rise of the regulatory state also signals the rise of expert-oriented deliberations\nand decision making. As seen from the \u2018credible commitment\u2019 rationale, depoliticizing the decision making process is achieved by delegating powers to arms\u2019 length\nbodies such as IRA. Concerns are raised by civil society actors that this will lead to\ncomplete de-politicization of sectoral policy making (Prayas 2007). This concern is\nhighly relevant in a developing country context where there is a large section of the\nsociety which may not be able to participate in such expertocratic decision making\nprocesses. The concerns and demands of these sections would be neglected for want\nof voice and concrete evidences. Mobilizing analysis-based evidences will be a\n\n \n104\n\nS.

The most direct mechanism is the official appointment of\n\u2018consumer representatives\u2019 in the state electricity commissions in India for protection of public interest.7 The consumer representatives in this case have been empowered to receive all information pertaining to regulatory processes and also to\nparticipate and intervene in all regulatory proceedings. Another set of conditions\nthat make the decision making favorable for pro-poor and pro-people interventions\nis operationalization of principles of transparency, accountability and public participation (Nakhooda et al. 2007). Such procedural matters contribute to what is termed\nas \u2018procedural accountability\u2019 of IRAs (Dubash 2008).\nThe analysis of the WRA laws in India shows that these aspects of \u2018procedural\naccountability\u2019 have not been incorporated adequately (Wagle and Warghade 2010).\nFor example, there is provision for public participation while determining tariff.\nThis helped in ensuring active participation of stakeholders in the tariff proceedings\ninitiated by MWRRA. But there is no provision for public participation in MWRRA\nAct in the crucial function of determination of water allocation. Apart from members of MWRRA, there is provision in the law for appointment of \u2018special invitees\u2019\nrepresenting different regions of the state. But these invitees do not anywhere\nresemble the likes of consumer representatives. There are hardly any concrete propeople or pro-poor interventions done by these invitees that might have influenced\nthe regulatory actions and decision in the past.\nUnless strong transparency and accountability provisions are made in the regulatory law it is not possible to avert the situation of complete depoliticization of sectoral decisions. An associated concern raised in this regard is the possibility of\n\u2018regulatory capture\u2019, a widely studied and discussed theory in the regulatory literature (Dubash 2008). Depoliticization and expertocratic procedures provide avenues\nfor capturing of the decision making process by the intellectual and resourceful\nstakeholders like corporate entities. Because the avenues for political mobilization\nare reduced, the poor and disadvantaged sections will remain marginalized in such\nregulatory decision making process. Who will then represent the interest of these\ngroups in the expert-oriented regulatory process, is a major concern that need serious consideration in the regulatory design. Measures to enhance the \u2018procedural\naccountability\u2019 form an important counter measure to thwart attempts of regulatory\ncapture.\n\n7\nRefer the Electricity Act 2003 (Source: http://powermin.nic.in/acts_notification/electricity_\nact2003/preliminary.htm).\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n6.7\n\n105\n\nWay Ahead\n\nIndependent regulation in the water sector is still in its experimental phase in India.\nThe debates arising from the design and implementation of the water regulatory\nmodels in India have raised serious questions on the appropriateness of the model.\nThis reflects on the peculiar nature of the regulatory state in the developing countries. It also reflects on the peculiar nature of water as a distinct resource. There is\ncertainly a need to relook at the existing models and evolve more context-friendly\nmodels instead of just transplanting context-free models.\nThe literature provides some alternative directions with regard to regulatory\nmodels. The independent regulatory is an apex-body overlooking the whole of the\nsector. Such an apex-level institutional structure combined with its expert-oriented\nproceedings creates a tendency towards centralization of decision making. Such a\n\u2018centered\u2019 model of regulation is being challenged by several regulatory scholars.\nMost prominent work in this regard is the theory of \u2018regulatory space\u2019 proposed by\nHancher and Moran (1989) (Scott 2001). The authors use the metaphor of space to\nsuggest that regulation is shaped not by a single power-center, like an IRA, but is\nshaped by multiple stakeholders active in a regulatory space. The regulatory power\nin the space is dispersed and not concentrated. The regulatory space is further\nshaped by the context that exists in given place and time. The interface and interactions among various organizations is the key in understanding regulation and its\noutcomes. This leads us to a \u2018decentered\u2019 approach to regulation (Black 2002).\nThe decentered approach to regulation is a potential alternative approach for a\ndeveloping country like India where the democratic set-up and the structural features of inequity demands for more and more decentralization of power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d91b9869-307d-48b9-99ab-15ebaef3456b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d91b9869-307d-48b9-99ab-15ebaef3456b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c30c3f62-48e7-4e5d-99e9-137403eaf4df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba341da4a8c6726ca552f6f8d1ec994e25d7ea86670dae73588fad5a2f33d508"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b4f5515-edb7-4fda-bef7-a1d0097aaf8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a85fb0eb6aea2e3fe5cacdb55f82a73b1d055e275f085e6fb1e4e93a002e25f9"}}, "hash": "4a5f14f2637bfd1f77137d8740759a1b3e8c28269719a2104b5db780a2c6a249", "text": "The evidences of this can be seen in the model bill drafted by a group constituted by\nPlanning Commission of India on behalf of the 12th Five-Year Plan.8 The group\ncomprised representatives of governmental and non-governmental organizations.\nThe draft bill, which is the outcome of this consultative process, resembles the\ndecentered approach. It envisages a decentered regulatory space where regulatory\npower is not concentrated in an apex-level IRA. It recognizes and attempts to balance the multiple sources of regulatory power, held among the political functionaries, regulatory bodies, expert bodies and water users\u2019 organizations.\nThe implications of such a model can be two fold. One, it can provide appropriate spaces and opportunities for the disadvantaged sections to influence the regulatory process. Second, it will ensure that the political functionaries do not get a free\nhand on making decisions in a closed-door manner.

Warghade\n\nprocesses that the bill proposes, there is a need for moderation of some of the aspects\nof the bill while adapting the same to specific state-level context. This moderation\nis necessary to reduce the administrative and regulatory burden that might make it\ninfeasible to operate on ground.\nAnother arena to look for alternative models is the \u2018sunshine commission\u2019 model\noriginally developed and practiced by Charles Adams, one of the earliest thinkers\non regulation in USA (MCraw 1984). In the 1870s, Charles Adams pioneered the\nthought of a very different form of independent regulation which he called \u2018sunshine commission\u2019. Adams argued that continuous learning and knowledge building\non a particular sector is not possible at the level of the legislatures because of their\nshort tenures in a particular sector of governance. There is a need for a permanent\nand independent analytical expertise within the government which can be developed through an independent commission.\nApart from undertaking study and disclosure, Adams emphasized on the role of\nregulator \u201cas sort of lens by means of which the otherwise scattered rays of public\nopinion could be concentrated to focus and brought to bear upon a given point\u201d\n(MCraw 1984, p. 15). He proposed a \u2018Sunshine Commission\u2019 which would \u201cshed\nthe cleansing light of disclosure on the hitherto secret affairs of business corporations\u201d (ibid). Discouraging direct intervention through tariff setting, Adams emphasized on regulation through publication and disclosure. Enlightenment was seen as\nan essential prelude to action. Avoiding the confrontationist approach in regulation,\nAdams followed the strategy of enlightment, assistance, and prodding in the\nMassachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners (1869), the first important IRA in\nUSA which Adams not only founded but also worked as its Chairperson. Moving\naway from this \u2018sunshine\u2019 approach the later commissions in USA engaged more\ndirectly through tariff setting and other regulatory functions. Adams warned that\nsuch a higher engagement will entangle the regulatory into controversies and redtapism around rate and other regulatory interventions. This will be at the cost of\nlosing out on the larger role of bringing the \u201cinterests of the public and corporation\ninto identity\u201d (ibid).\nConsidering the diversity in conception of water as a resource and the plurality\nof values attached to water in India, the idea of the \u2018cleansing light\u2019 of knowledge\nand a lens for bringing together the \u2018scattered rays of public opinion\u2019 to focus on\nkey common interests, seems to be worth exploring. There are several government\nauthorities engaged in data collection and dissemination but the approach is far\nfrom Adams \u2018sunshine commission\u2019. The notion of water as a common resource\nand the process of evolving a common interest that could drive policy and regulation\ncannot be institutionalized without a facilitative role of such a commission. This\nbrings in focus the argument developed by Dubash and Morgan on regulatory models as the potential harbingers of \u2018repoliticization\u2019 mainly due to their procedural\ncomponent (Dubash and Morgan 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b4f5515-edb7-4fda-bef7-a1d0097aaf8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b4f5515-edb7-4fda-bef7-a1d0097aaf8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d91b9869-307d-48b9-99ab-15ebaef3456b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a5f14f2637bfd1f77137d8740759a1b3e8c28269719a2104b5db780a2c6a249"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ecc6747-d141-4108-9d04-e45ba925a904", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9540f35b15d8b85bd4a737e9fd148284a6c70523fad86f7b68ef33089da5cfe"}}, "hash": "a85fb0eb6aea2e3fe5cacdb55f82a73b1d055e275f085e6fb1e4e93a002e25f9", "text": "A decentered approach, with a strong\nknowledge component (sunshine commission), and backed by a pro-people normative framework may be a good starting point for building an effective and comprehensive alternative framework for water regulation in India.\n\n \n6\n\nIndependent Regulatory Agencies in Water Sector in India: Debate and Discourse\n\n107\n\nReferences\nBlack, J.

This paper contributes to the\ndiscourse by presenting a balanced analytical point of view from a series of studies\nconducted by the International Water Management Institute and its partners. The\nstudies have analyzed the drivers and assumptions used to justify the NRLP and\nhave assessed hydrological, financial and social implications of the NRLP water\ntransfers. These studies find that the underlying assumptions have either changed\nover time or have flaws and alternative options are not given the consideration these\nneed and deserve. Given these and many other factors, the hydrological, financial\nand social benefits and cost, if implemented in its present form, are mixed. However,\nthe paper also argues that the idea of NRLP may have come a decade or two soon;\nand that a slew of upcoming contingencies shall not only change the tenor of the\ndebate around inter-basin water transfers but even make a compelling case for them,\neven if in a different form than the present proposal.\nKeywords River linking project \u2022 NRLP \u2022 River basin \u2022 Water transfers \u2022 Storage \u2022\nIrrigation \u2022 Groundwater\n\n7.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor a long period, the notables in India have argued that the answer to the droughtproneness of western and peninsular India lies in the flood-proneness of the east,\nand vice versa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ed0dba1-ace2-4407-98a8-5907a81ea911": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ed0dba1-ace2-4407-98a8-5907a81ea911", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ecc6747-d141-4108-9d04-e45ba925a904", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9540f35b15d8b85bd4a737e9fd148284a6c70523fad86f7b68ef33089da5cfe"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a539619-01b9-4122-b8dc-352642e80085", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dadc8cf7a43706e05b6a21b0574ad224379ece358abdf9156b314ae34c5f9f6d"}}, "hash": "09bdc49be5b87ec276c3d435fa6a9f200f7fde89b4d1030082638a267929109d", "text": "Few grand proposals of linking rivers evoked the imagination and\nT.

Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\nenthusiasm of water stressed Indians from time to time. At the forefront were,\nSir Arthur Cotton\u2019s plan of linking rivers in southern India in the nineteenth century,\nDr K. L. Rao\u2019s plan of linking Ganga and Cauvery in the 1970s, and Captain\nDastur\u2019s plan of lateral Himalayan canal linking Ravi and Brahmaputra and an\ninterconnected Garland Canal girdling peninsular in the later seventies. In addition,\nthe latest is the grandiose scheme to link Himalayan rivers and river in peninsular\nIndia\u2014those currently under discussion as National River Linking Project (NRLP).\nIn the early 1990s, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) was entrusted\nto start detailed planning for a mega-scheme of NRLP under the national perspective plan for water resources development (NWDA 2012a).\nImplementing mega-schemes, which require pre-feasibility, feasibility, and environment impact studies, is a long drawn out process. Many proposals do not even go\nbeyond the drawing board, as the planners themselves dismiss ideas as too grandiose. Nevertheless, in 2003, acting on public interest petitions, the Supreme Court of\nIndia has decided that the time had come for the nation to pull its act together on the\nwaterfront, and enjoined the Government of India to complete all planning required\nto complete the NRLP by 2016. President Abdul Kalam too endorsed the idea and\nvigorously argued that the government should plunge headlong in its implementation without wasting time unduly in studies.\nThe ruling National Democratic Alliance government at that time\u2014constituted a\nhigh-powered, multi-disciplinary task force to embark upon the NRLP project\nforthwith in deference to the Supreme Court\u2019s injunction. However, a groundswell\nof opposition to the project emerged from environmental groups and civil society\norganizations with a battery of arguments representing a variety of perspectives.\nMost of these did not even address the benefit-cost issues but questioned the basic\nmodel of water resources planning and management through large-scale dams and\ncanal networks (\u2018the disease of gigantism\u2019, as one antagonist referred to it) that the\nNRLP exemplified (Alagh et al. 2006). The interest in the project has waned since\nthen, or at least placed in the back burner until the next major nation-wide drought.\nThe idea of linking Himalayan Rivers with peninsular and western ones has however proved hard to kill. Like phoenix, it rose from its ashes again in 2012, when the\nSupreme Court took note of it suo moto, and based largely on an economic analysis\nby the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER 2008), again\nenjoined the government to implement the project so as to complete it by 2016!\n(Venkatesan 2012). The NCAER study showed NRLP\u2019s economic benefits will\nexceed its costs, but it is not clear whether the battery of assumptions would hold\nunder intense scrutiny. Once again, the civil society started to express anxiety of the\nSupreme Court decision (Iyer 2012; Narain 2012). The responses of the Government\nof India to the second Supreme Court decision and on people\u2019s concerns are not\nclear yet.\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper discusses major assumptions and implications\nof NRLP water transfers on Indian water, land and social scape. After this brief\nintroduction, the next section, on the NRLP project, gives a brief technical overview\nof the project concept.

The final section\ndiscusses under what contingencies a project like NRLP would be required to\naddress India\u2019s water woes and their implications on policy and research.\n\n7.2\n7.2.1\n\nThe NRLP Project\nHimalayan and Peninsular Component\n\nThe NRLP intends to transfer water from surplus river basins to ease the water\nshortages in western and southern India, while mitigating the impacts of recurrent\nfloods in eastern India (NWDA 2012a). Conceptualized in two components,\nHimalayan and Peninsular (Fig. 7.1), the project will build 30 link canals and\napproximately 3,000 storages to connect 37 Himalayan and Peninsular rivers. The\ncanals, which are planned to be 50\u2013100 m wide and more than 6 m deep, will handle\n178 billion cubic meters (BCM) of inter-basin water transfer/per year. The\nHimalayan and Peninsular components will transfer 33 and 141BCM of water\nrespectively, through a combined network of close to 15,000 km long distributary\ncanals.\nThe Himalayan Component, with 16 river links, has two sub-components one\nlinking Ganga, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi Basins (links 11\u201314 in Fig. 7.1), and the\nother comprising links between eastern Ganga tributaries and Chambal and\nSabarmati river basins (links 1\u201310). Altogether, these transfers intend to mitigate\nfloods in the eastern parts of the Ganga Basin, and provide the western parts of the\nbasin with improved irrigation and water supplies. The Himalayan component\nneeds several large dams in Bhutan and Nepal to store and transfer floodwaters from\nthe tributaries of the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, and within India to transfer the\nsurplus waters of the Mahanadi and Godavari rivers.\nThe peninsular component, with 14 major links has four sub-components: (1)\nlinking the Mahanadi-Godavari-Krishna-Cauvery-Vaigai Rivers; (2) linking west\nflowing rivers that are south of Tapi and north of Bombay; (3) linking the KenBetwa and Parbati-Kalisindh-Chambal rivers; and (4) diverting the flow in some of\nthe west flowing rivers to the eastern side. The en route irrigation under the peninsular\ncomponent will serve a substantial area as proposed under the NRLP, and much\nthese beneficiary lands are in arid and semi-arid western and peninsular India.\nThe \u2018back-of-the-envelope calculations\u2019, the best available so far, suggest that\nthe project will altogether cost about US$ 123 billion (or Indian Rs. 560,000 crore)\nat 2000 prices. This includes US$ 23 billion (In Rs. 106,000 crore) for the peninsular component, US$ 41 billion (Rs. 185,000 crore) for the Himalayan component\nand US$ 59 billion (In Rs. 269,000 crore) for the hydroelectric component. Given\nthat India\u2019s Wholesale Price Index in 2012 is 120 % higher than in 2000, the project\ncost at current prices would be more like Rs. 1.19 trillion (US$ 216 billion).\n\n \n112\n\nT. Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\nFig. 7.1 Links of the Himalayan and peninsular components (Source: IWMI (2008))\n\nNWDA claims the project will add 34 G watts (GW) of hydropower capacity,\nwhich includes 4 and 30 GW from the peninsular and Himalayan components\nrespectively. Approximately 3,700 MW would be required to lift water across major\nwatershed ridges by up to 116 m. It also adds 35 million hectares to India\u2019s irrigated\nareas, and generates an unknown volume of navigation and fishery benefits (NWDA\n2012a). One worry with these numbers is their reliability. Water infrastructure plans\nin India are often exaggerate estimates of likely benefits and under-estimate costs,\nmaking them appear highly desirable. As projects unroll, the actual benefits turn out\nmuch smaller and costs much higher than shown in the planning documents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d4ee11c-6812-48e8-8941-5eb4ad630818": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d4ee11c-6812-48e8-8941-5eb4ad630818", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a539619-01b9-4122-b8dc-352642e80085", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dadc8cf7a43706e05b6a21b0574ad224379ece358abdf9156b314ae34c5f9f6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ace8ac2-d5c1-4197-82fb-38c615725c9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bfd8bbebb14b6b79dbd7a12325557bf6c5afa4c179f093842c40782c9407b3b"}}, "hash": "f4b4b5aed15cf670b96af8f318319885ad7f2e79a9288d4e77a7f81f5e714de3", "text": "7.2.2\n\nGrandiosity of the NRLP\n\nThe NRLP is unique in its unrivalled grandiosity. If fully implemented, it could be\nthe largest water infrastructure project ever undertaken in the world. The NRLP will\nhandle four times more water than China\u2019s South to North water transfer project,\nwhich is one of the largest inter-basin water transfer projects implemented in the\nworld at present (Stone and Jia 2006). The NRLP will also handle four times more\nwater than the Three Gorges Dam; five times all the inter-basin water transfers\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n113\n\ncompleted in the U.S.A; and six times more than the total transfer of the six interbasin water transfers projects already operational in India namely, Sharda-Sahayak;\nBeas-Sutlej; Madhopur-Beas Link; Kurnool- Cudappa-Cana; Periyar- Vegai Link;\nand Telgu Ganga.\nThe cost of the NRLP could be three times the cost of China\u2019s South\u2013north water\ntransfers scheme, six times the cost of Three Gorges Project, and twenty times the\nestimated costs of the Red-Dead connection in the Middle East. The project will\nrequire a larger investment than the sum total of all irrigation investments made by\nthe governments of colonial and free India since 1830. The actual cost could most\nlikely be several times more than the present US$ 123 billion \u2018guest estimate\u2019, when\nit considers the cost of land acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement.\nAlthough enjoined to complete by 2016, the way irrigation projects in India have\nproceeded during recent decades, general agreement is that this grandiose project\nmay not fully complete even by 2050. Varghese (2003) suggests, realistically, that\nNRLP could be a 50\u2013100 year project. Only nine of the 30 proposed links are independent and can be constructed and operated without the other links. In the first\nstage of the Project, which won government approval, a 230-km canal will transfer\nwater from the Ken River to the Betwa River in the northern Madhya Pradesh. A\ndam and small hydroelectric plant in the Ken River will be located in the Panna\nTiger Reserve. Work on the first component of this US$ 1.1 billion project is underway, and will alone take 8 years to complete (Bagla 2006).\n\n7.3\n7.3.1\n\nJustification of the NRLP\nAugmenting Utilizable Water Supply\n\nThe raisons d\u2019\u00eatre of the project is the accentuating water scarcity in western and\npeninsular India, low storage capacity and per capita utilizable water supply, high\nspatial and temporal variability of rainfall and the associated droughts and floods.\nIn India\u2019s 19 major river basins, only 55 % of the total renewable water resources\n(TRWR) are utilizable (GOI 1999). The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins, which\ncover one third of the country\u2019s total land area, are home to 44 % of India\u2019s population, but drain more than 60 % of the country\u2019s TRWR. The Brahmaputra sub-basin\nalone drains 31 % of the TRWR, but due to geographical restrictions, only 4 % of\nthe TRWR are potentially utilizable. In contrast, the Krishna, Cauvery and, Penner\nriver basins and few other eastward flowing rivers cover 16 % of the land area, host\n17 % of the population, but drain only 6 % of total water resources.\nDue to this spatial variability of water supply, more than 200 million people have\nper capita utilizable water supply below 1,000 m3/day, which, according to\nFalkenmark et al. (1989), indicates severe regional water scarcity. Due to overdevelopment, some basins are physically water-scarce (Amarasinghe et al. 2005).\nOne of the solutions suggested to deal with increasing water scarcity, is augmenting\n\n \n114\n\nT. Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\nthe utilizable water supply of water scarce basins by transferring waters from surplus basins.\nLow reservoir storage capacity is another concern. At present, it is only 200 m3\nper person at present. These result in economic water scarcity, which, many fear,\nwill impede economic growth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ace8ac2-d5c1-4197-82fb-38c615725c9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ace8ac2-d5c1-4197-82fb-38c615725c9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d4ee11c-6812-48e8-8941-5eb4ad630818", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4b4b5aed15cf670b96af8f318319885ad7f2e79a9288d4e77a7f81f5e714de3"}, "3": {"node_id": "68ef17b4-9be6-4f49-9b61-f73212effece", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9efce9cb59f516346f8383e19ac13eed8a03c9985daba6567213407cc10cc61b"}}, "hash": "8bfd8bbebb14b6b79dbd7a12325557bf6c5afa4c179f093842c40782c9407b3b", "text": "These result in economic water scarcity, which, many fear,\nwill impede economic growth. In comparison, other arid and semi-arid regions of\nthe world have invested heavily in storage creation; Brazil, Australia and the U.S.A,\nhave per capita storage capacity of 3,388, 4,717 and 5,961 m3 respectively. Even\nChina has increased its per capita storage capacity to 2,486 m3. For this, and the fact\nthat variability of rainfall is increasing due to climate change, many consider that it\nis imperative that India increases its storage for regulating the vast amount of runoff\nthat otherwise cannot be beneficially utilized. The proposed NRLP water transfers\nwill increase utilizable surface water resources by an estimated 25 % and improve\nwater availability in water-scarce regions.\nFlood and droughts inflict heavy damages. Annual floods, on average, affect\nmore than 7 million ha of the total land area, 3 million ha of the cropped area and\n34 million people, mostly in the eastern parts. Floods inflict an annual damage of\nwell over US$ 220 million (Rs. 1,000 crores) (GOI 1999). In contrast, recurrent\ndroughts affect 19 % of the country, 68 % of the cropped area and 12 % of the population (Nair and Radhakrishna 2005). Reservoir storages and the canal diversions in\nNRLP would, it is argued, reduce flood damages by 35 % (Sinha et al. 2005) and\nease drought-proneness in semi-arid and arid parts. Also, NRLP will make 12 km3\nof water available for domestic and industrial sectors in these drought-prone districts. Many argue that diverting a portion of the surplus floodwater from the\nHimalayan Rivers into the drought-prone areas can only be a win-win proposition\nfor the country.\n\n7.3.2\n\nMeeting Food Self Sufficiency\n\nSelf-sufficiency in food grains is a key plank of the NRLP justification. Lay circles\nconsider that the report by the National Commission of Integrated Water Resources\nDevelopment (GOI 1999) as the first cut justification of the NRLP\u2019s design-concept.\nAssuming the criticality of maintaining national food self-sufficiency and agricultural exports, the Commission projected a grain demand in the range of 425\u2013494\nmillion tonnes for India by 2050 and argued for the need to increase the country\u2019s\nirrigation potential to 160 million ha, which is 20 million more than what can be\nachieved without basin transfers (NWDA 2012b). The surface irrigation from NRLP\nalone is expected to add 25 million ha of irrigated land.\nImproving rural employment is another justification for the NRLP. The rural\npopulation in India will peak at about 775 million by 2015 (UN 2004). The\nCommission projected that the rural population will decrease to about 610 million\nby 2050, but assumes that a large part of the rural population will remain agriculturally active in the future.\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n7.4\n7.4.1\n\n115\n\nAnalyses of Core Assumptions\nDemographic Change\n\nChanges in demography are critical to NRLP food and water demand projections.\nThe NCIWRD projected the state-wise population growth by pro-rata distribution\nof national population projections from the 1991 population census. However, the\nnew regional projections (Mahmood and Kundu 2009) incorporating age-size structure, HIV/AIDS and adjusted fertility and mortality estimates from the 2001 census,\nshow vastly different emerging patterns. Although the total national population projections are not different, new projections show that many water scarce states,\nincluding Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab, and Tami Nadu will have\nappreciable decline in population trends before 2050. Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra,\nOrissa and the West Bengal too will experience a moderate decline, while Uttar\nPradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh will show an increase\nin population. Thus, unlike in the NLRP assumptions, the latter group of states\u2014\nwhich are to cede water to southern and western states\u2014is where pressure for farmlands and demand for irrigation will continue to be high.\nRural employment was a major driver of India\u2019s past irrigation development, the\nfact that NCIWRD has also emphasized. However, according Sharma and Bhaduri\n(2009), today\u2019s younger generation in Indian villages has different perception and\npriorities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68ef17b4-9be6-4f49-9b61-f73212effece": {"__data__": {"id_": "68ef17b4-9be6-4f49-9b61-f73212effece", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ace8ac2-d5c1-4197-82fb-38c615725c9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bfd8bbebb14b6b79dbd7a12325557bf6c5afa4c179f093842c40782c9407b3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "39899689-e4b0-4629-82f8-c87e8096c21e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f4aad838c919c1f19c8adb323aebf026dde72510cdc21ea5f0f7407c2b9e619"}}, "hash": "9efce9cb59f516346f8383e19ac13eed8a03c9985daba6567213407cc10cc61b", "text": "There is a high likelihood that today\u2019s young rural farmers will move out\nof agriculture, or at least keep it as a secondary income activity, regardless of\nincreased access to irrigation. This is more evident among rural youth who have\ndifferent skills and better education. The tendency of moving out of agriculture is\nhigher where the distance to travel to town or urban centers is less. Certainly, future\ngenerations of India will be more educated, and will be acquainted with better skills.\nIn addition, many rural centers will become small towns and towns to sprawling\nurban centers. Infrastructure facilities such as access to roads, electricity, and telecommunication are also increasing. Thus, migration from full time agriculture to\nnon-farm rural and urban livelihood will increase; especially in economically more\ndynamic states where NRLP proposes to transfer Himalayan water.\n\n7.4.2\n\nFood Self Sufficiency\n\nThe NCIWRD has projected that India will have to produce 450 million MT (or\n284 kg/person/year) of food grains by 2050, and an additional 45 million MT for\nfeed, seed and waste. However, Amarasinghe et al. (2007) have shown significant\nchanges in food consumption patterns over the recent decades. Because of these\nchanges, India\u2019s total grain demand shall increase from 217 million MT in 2000 to\nabout 380 million MT by 2050. This projection includes the feed grain demand of\n\n \n116\n\nT. Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\n120 million MT, which is a tenfold increase from the present levels, a factor that the\nNCIWRD study has significantly underestimated. Even then, the projections of\nAmarasinghe et al. study (2007) s fall short of the commission\u2019s projection by 115\nmillion MT.\nThe Commission also assumed that self-sufficiency in food grains as a major\ndriver of irrigation cropping patterns and water demand. The self-sufficiency\nassumption was based on three concerns: (1) India has a large population and food\ngrain is the staple food, so, no major deficits are acceptable; (2) Agriculture is the\nmain driver of economic growth and contributes to a large share of the GDP; and (3)\nIndia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are too low to permit large scale imports of food\ngrains. However, all three reasons are no longer valid in a rapidly growing India:\nfood consumption patterns are fast changing, agriculture sector contribution to GDP\nis rapidly decreasing; foreign exchange reserve is increasing; and imports and\nexports, even in the agriculture sector, are growing (Malik 2009). The only concern\nthat demands a significant level of self-sufficiency is that large grain imports from a\ncountry of India\u2019s size could potentially impact world prices and hurt the very consumer that imports are expected to help feed.\n\n7.4.3\n\nYield Growth\n\nMany argue that the Commission took an unduly bleak view of the potential to\nincrease food grain yields. The Commission assumed average grain yield to increase\nfrom 1.5 tonnes/ha in 1993 to 3.1 tonnes/ha by 2050. However, if India can double the\nland and water productivities (1.67 tonnes/ha and 0.48 kg/m3 of consumptive water\nuse in 2000) in 50 years, it can not only be self-sufficient but also will not require any\nadditional irrigated land or withdrawals for food grains (Amarasinghe et al. 2010).\nThe moot question is: will India be unable to increase its average grain yield to\n4.0 tonnes/ha, which is the present level of China, even over a 50-year period?\nResearch suggests that a significant potential exists for larger yield growth. There is\nsignificant variation in yield even within a same irrigation system or in the same\nregion growing similar crops (Kumar et al. 2009) or in regions of similar consumptive water use (Amarasinghe et al. 2010). Increasing the reliability of irrigation and\nincreasing the application of inputs can significantly increase grain yields in irrigation\nareas. Sharma et al. (2010) showed that even small doses of supplemental irrigation\nduring critical periods of crop growth can double the productivity in the rainfed areas.\n\n7.4.4\n\nFuture of Irrigation\n\nThe NCIWRD\u2019s prognosis for how India\u2019s future of irrigation shapes up is the most\ncontentious. The composition of surface water and groundwater area in 1993 was\n55 % and 45 % of the gross irrigated area.

However, the developments in recent decades\nshow a completely opposite trend (Fig. 7.2). There has been no appreciable increase\nin surface irrigated area in India, although, due largely to private small-scale investments, the groundwater irrigated area has recorded a rapid growth.\nToday, net groundwater irrigated area is 39 million ha, which constitutes 63 % of\nthe net irrigated area, and contributes to 64 % of the gross irrigated area. It is therefore, largely due to this increase in groundwater irrigation that India has achieved in\n2000 the projected gross irrigated area of 79 million ha for the year 2010. But, the\nsustainability of these trends depends on how far groundwater irrigation can grow\nwithout any surface irrigation growth?\nMany contend that increase in groundwater irrigation is not possible without\nsurface irrigation recharge. But a substantial part of groundwater irrigated area\ngrowth in the last decade took place in districts outside the command areas (Shah\net al. 2003) and showed no significant spatial dependence on surface irrigation\ngrowth (Bhaduri et al. 2009). The analysis by Amarasinghe et al. (2008) shows that\nif the 10 million ha of net surface irrigated area from the projects under construction\nand another 25\u201335 million ha of net groundwater irrigated area are added to the\npresent level of irrigation, the gross irrigated area will increase to about 130 to 140\nmillion ha. This is the area required for achieving the Commission\u2019s exaggerated\nprojections of, and the self-sufficiency targets of grains. With this increase, groundwater irrigation by 2050 will cover more than 70 % of the gross irrigated area.

Can Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) in a decentralized format enable\nIndia to use its aquifers as large-scale storages in place of surface storages? These\nare critical questions for India\u2019s water future.\n\n7.4.5\n\nIrrigation Efficiency\n\nThe Commission assumed a significant increase in irrigation efficiencies\u2014from\n35\u201340 % now to 60 % in the future for surface irrigation, and from 65 %\u201370 % to\n75 % for groundwater irrigation across all the river basins. The little information we\nhave today on the variation of irrigation efficiency across river basins is not adequate to predict future directions. However, they show that groundwater irrigation\nefficiency is already close to or even higher than the commission\u2019s projections\n(Kumar et al. 2009). But the surface irrigation efficiency has shown virtually no\nincrease over the recent decades.\nIt is also clear that many water saving technologies, especially micro-irrigation\nsystems, can significantly increase water use efficiency.

This too may work in favor of larger contribution\nfrom groundwater to India\u2019s food self-sufficiency.\nMany water-scarce river basins approaching high degrees of closure as there are\nno flows to the sea on many days of the year. In these basins, projected application\nefficiencies of surface irrigation are low, but they have high basin efficiency due to\nreuse of the return flows of irrigation. Thus increasing irrigation efficiency in one\nlocation, and then using the saved water for new locations or for other purposes,\nwould certainly affect some other water users elsewhere. We need to know more on\nthe interactions of efficiencies at the system and basin levels before we can make\nfirm statements on the potential improvement of efficiency in the surface systems.\nOr, at least we need conservative assumptions on the potential increases based on\nthe information currently available.\n\n7.4.6\n\nRain-fed Agriculture\n\nDid the Commission\u2019s report overlook the potential of rain-fed agriculture?\nSurprisingly, the Commission projected only a modest growth in rain fed yields\nfrom 1.0 tonnes/ha in 1993 to 1.5 tonnes/ha by 2050. At present, rain-fed area\naccounts for 56 % of the grain crop but contributes only 39 % of the total production. But, by doubling the rain-fed yield to about 2.0 tonnes/ha over the next 50\nyears; the grain production on the existing rain-fed lands can alone be increased by\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n119\n\n81 million metric tonnes. This kind of increase in grain production can meet a substantial part of the future food demand.\nSharma et al. (2010) find that frequent occurrence of mid-season and terminal\ndroughts were the main causes for low yield or crop failure in rain-fed cropped\nlands. Small supplemental irrigation, especially during the water-stress period of the\nreproductive stage of crop growth, can benefit a substantial part of the rain-fed area.\nThis requires collecting only 18\u201320 km3/year of water through rainwater harvesting\nusing small-scale structures, and will have little or no effect on downstream users.\n\n7.4.7\n\nEco-system Water Needs\n\nThe Commission\u2019s water allocation to eco-system services is only 10 km3\u2013less than\n1 % of the mean annual runoff of all river basins. Even the Commission has admitted that this is not an adequate provision. IWMI research shows that in many basins,\nmaintaining a healthy river ecosystem requires much more minimum environmental\nflows (EF) (Smakhtin and Anputhas 2006).\nLevel of minimum EF needed depends on the natural hydrological variability of\nthe river and the maintenance requirements under various environmental management classes (Smakhtin et al. 2007). The former is an endogenous driver of the water\nsystem and the latter is exogenous. Environmental management classes, which\ndepend on qualitative importance assigned by people, could range from pristine (natural) condition to slightly to moderately to critically modified conditions, and the\nminimum EF could accordingly vary from 70 % to 15 % of the mean annual runoff.\nAt present, many of the water surplus river basins considered in the NRLP fall in\nmoderately modified category (Amarasinghe et al. 2008). If eco-systems\u2019 water\nneeds get high priority, then effective water supply that is available for potentially\nutilizable supply for other uses would diminish. In fact, many argue that environmental water demand should also include the needs of wetlands, for cleaning the\npolluted rivers, for fisheries\u2019 needs in the down streams etc. All these, and the resulting ecosystem water needs will have a significant impact on inter-basin water transfers, as the ultimate decision of the surplus or the level of closure of river basins is\ndecided on what proportion of the utilizable water resources are required for the\neco-system water needs.\n\n7.5\n7.5.1\n\nImplications of NRLP Water Transfers\nHydrological Feasibility\n\nSurplus water in river basins and hydrological feasibility of large water transfers is\na topic that is much in discussion; it is a highly contentious topic, too. Many contest\nthe very notion that there can be water surpluses in river basins. One such extreme\nview, held by Bandyopadhyaya and Praveen (2003), is that \u201c\u2026from a holistic\n\n \n120\n\nT.

Iyer (2003) is acerbic in his comments on\nNRLP projects: \u201cAre rivers bundles of pipelines to be cut, turned around, welded\nand re-joined? This is technological hubris\u2014arrogance\u2014of the worst description,\nprometheanism of the crassest kind. The country needs to be saved from this\nmadness.\u201d\nBut others argue differently. For them, some large Indian River basins have vast\nnon-utilizable water resources, even after meeting all human and eco-system service\u2019s needs. The total renewable water resource of the Brahmaputra basin is about\n584 km3, which is about a quarter of India\u2019s total water resources. But, only about a\nquarter of that is potentially utilizable within the basin. Mohile and Anand (2009)\nshowed significant non-utilizable water resources also available in Mahanadi and\nGodavari basins. Rapidly expanding population and increasing demand in other\nbasins can beneficially use a part of these non-utilizable water resources, without\nnoticeable impact on the eco-systems.\nAlthough major donor basins have significant surpluses, Smakhtin et al. (2007)\nshowed that the use of annual data in feasibility reports shows up more water perceived to be available than actual for transfers at some transfer sites. This study\nconcluded that when intra-annual variability of flow is accounted, any transfers of\nwater at the transfer sites within the Krishna river basin would affect the environmental water requirement in the Krishna delta or vice versa. Hydrological modeling\nof the Godavari (Polawaram)-Krishna (Vijayawada) link (Fig. 7.1) also confirms the\nabove finding that water transfers would affect the downstream users of the Godavari\nbasin (Bharati et al. 2008).\nMost recently, the Comprehensive Assessment of Food and Agriculture (CA\n2007) by IWMI and partners determined that investments in large-scale infrastructure is necessary in regions where there has historically been under-investment,\nsuch as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. That Assessment however also said\nthat investment in large-scale irrigation, even as a component of multi-purpose projects, is generally economically unattractive. But, Kumar and Saha (2008), based on\ndata of India\u2019s large and medium dams, shows that increasing the storage capacity\nthrough large/medium dams is important for rapid economic growth in India.\nThese concerns and others hint at the need to be more circumspect about largescale water transfers worldwide. However, more recently the pendulum has begun\nto swing back towards investments in water infrastructure. In some countries, most\nnotably in China, which did not have to depend on external sources to secure the\nnecessary financing, there have been many dams constructed in the recent past.\nAccording to the ICOLD World Register, China has 4,434 large dams (ICOLD\n2000), but the actual number can be as high as 22,000 according to other sources\n(WCD 2000). The WSSD in Johannesburg recognized hydropower as a renewable\nresource for power generation. And, the new World Bank water strategy (World\nBank 2004) laid the groundwork for a re-engagement of the multi-lateral banks in\nlarge-scale water infrastructure. All in all, the pendulum of global opinion has gradually moved again in favor of large dams, notwithstanding all the concerns that have\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n121\n\narisen during recent decades. This change in the worldview may influence Indian\nthinking about NRLP. Despite renewed attention to \u2018giganticism\u2019 in water infrastructure planning, the modalities to ensure that the infrastructure developed is\neffective and sustainable will still remain highly contentious\n\n7.5.2\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nEnvironmentalists are worried about the ecological impacts of the NRLP water\ntransfers of such a massive scale. In May 2003, the Government of India\u2019s own\nMinistry of Environment and Forests raised 23 environmental concerns about the\nNRLP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7adcffa0-3235-4984-b95d-c9dd07073026": {"__data__": {"id_": "7adcffa0-3235-4984-b95d-c9dd07073026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "afac7ac3-c970-48e3-8631-84162d430678", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b661ad55623afb10a12f81281443a9a49f228161ee7929ffe006bf406a9250f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9570319-8da3-4952-ba9b-49da24b677bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "036281e4a06b359858ce4087763ef5628a6d323f9987f31794046c517f1f8f57"}}, "hash": "3b0a37885f09a967b6c382d1dbb1ba60301fed1b34b4324bf035fb8f912c290c", "text": "Independent researchers too worry on many counts, including seismic hazard, especially in the Himalayan component (Bandyopadhyaya and Praveen 2003).\nMany worry also about the transfer of river pollution that accompanies inter-basin\nwater transfers. The potential loss of forests and biodiversity, of course, are recurring themes.\nWhen completed, some 3,000 plus storages reservoirs of NRLP, will substantially change the river flow patterns and impact sediment loads to down-stream deltas. Such reduction in sediments could shrink river delta, affecting production and\nmangrove ecosystems. Large numbers of reservoirs already constructed in the\nKrishna basin have contributed to the shrinking of the river delta (Gamage and\nSmakhtin 2008). Further construction under NRLP, on the one hand could only\nexacerbate the shrinking of delta, and on the other hand may reduce the environmental flows, which-if protected\u2014could partially arrest the shrinking delta.\nThe NRLP water transfers could also have both positive and negative externalities in terms of groundwater recharge and water logging. The proposed irrigation\ntransfers in the Godavari (Polawaram)-Krishna(Vijayawada) link could raise the\ngroundwater water level by 2 m and improve the groundwater profile of the overexploited blocks of the Krishna basin. Simultaneously, intensive surface irrigation\ncould increase the risk of water logging in about 16 % of the command area (Sharma\net al. 2008). Without precautionary planning, as in many other large irrigation\nschemes in the past (Sharma et al. 2010), disbenefits of water logging could easily\noffset the benefits of groundwater recharge.\n\n7.5.3\n\nIrrigation Benefits\n\nThe NRLP envisages many benefits: generation of hydropower, supply of much\nneeded drinking water to several million people, and industrial water supplies to\ndrought-prone and water-scarce cities in the west and south, mitigation of floods in\nthe east and droughts in the west and the south, and facilitation of inland navigation.\nHowever, increased irrigation is by far the largest benefit envisaged from the project. It adds 25 million ha through surface irrigation and 10 million ha through\ngroundwater irrigation to water-scarce western and peninsular regions. This in turn\n\n \n122\n\nT. Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\nshall generate more employment and boost crop output and farm incomes. It shall\nalso provide multiplier benefits through backward linkages such as farm equipment\nand input supplies and forward linkages such as agro-processing industries.\nAmong the many scathing criticisms that this key plank of the project has come\nunder, the most eloquent has been from Rath (2003). Based on simple, back of the\nenvelope calculations, Rath shows that assuming a 7 % interest rate per year, the\nannual capital costs and interest to recover the total capital over a period 50 years\nwill be US$ 110/ha (Rs. 2,015/acre @ 1 US$ = 45 In Rs) in the peninsular component and US$ 334/ha in the Himalayan component. For irrigating hybrid jawar\n(sorghum) in peninsular India, the required annual capital recovery cost alone will\nbe US$ 221/ha. Similarly, the annual capital recovery cost at 7 % interest over 50\nyears amounts to US$ 0.30 per watt of hydropower. At the same interest rate charged\nduring the construction period, the three components will cost US$ 252 billion (In\nRs. 1,147,873 crore), approximately double of what is now suggested. On the further assumption of a 5 % annual rate of inflation, the project will commit India to a\nproject outlay of US$ 22 billion (In Rs. 100,000 crore) per year.\nThere are other concerns about such large scale investment, given the past trends\nof irrigation investments and benefits. The most notable trends are:\n\u2022 India has invested more than US$ 24 billion (In Rs. 100,000 crore) since 1990 in\nmajor and medium irrigation, yet it has hardly increase the net surface irrigated\narea (Fig. 7.2). Tank irrigated area has been decreasing relentlessly\n\u2022 Among southern states Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, two of the major water\nrecipients of NRLP, have spent more than US$ 5 billion (In Rs. 22,500 crore) in\nmajor and medium irrigation since 1970, but lost more than 500,000 ha of net\ncanal irrigated area over the same period (Amarasinghe et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9570319-8da3-4952-ba9b-49da24b677bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9570319-8da3-4952-ba9b-49da24b677bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7adcffa0-3235-4984-b95d-c9dd07073026", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b0a37885f09a967b6c382d1dbb1ba60301fed1b34b4324bf035fb8f912c290c"}, "3": {"node_id": "02c1f356-9310-4f8d-909d-8cf2cd5d9625", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3cbc6095b6dec31678f9b581acba59d1e69261ce8c82e60ba5324af35fbb84fa"}}, "hash": "036281e4a06b359858ce4087763ef5628a6d323f9987f31794046c517f1f8f57", "text": "2009);\n\u2022 On the western front, Gujarat has already spent more than US$ 6 billion in the\nSardar-Sarovar Project, although the planned cost of construction was only US$\n1.5 billion (In Rs. 6,840 crore). In spite of the cost over-run, only 0.1 of the 1.8\nmillion ha of proposed area is irrigated (Talati and Shah 2009).\nEx-ante benefit: cost analyses of two link canals\u2014Godawari (Polavaram)Krishna (Vijayawada) and Ken-Bethwa\u2014show similar trends. Major parts of the\ncommand areas in both links are already irrigated by groundwater or pre-existing\nschemes. In the Godavari-Krishna link, groundwater already irrigates 90 % of the\nen-route canal command. In the Ken-Bethwa link, rainfall is sufficient for the Kharif\nseason crop cultivation, for which a substantial part of the water transfers under the\nlink is planned. These studies show that when the canal links are considered individually, direct and indirect benefits per every cubic meter of water consumed or\ndelivered are rather low even under most optimistic scenarios of cropping patterns\n(Bhaduri et al. 2009; Amarasinghe et al. 2008).\nHowever, many of the NRLP links, such as those in the peninsular component,\nare inter-dependent. Water transfers to a river basin from up-stream links are a substitute for water transfers out from the basin from downstream links. These form a\nlarge project with many small components. Inocencio and McCornick (2008) have\nshown that large projects with many smaller schemes, with diversified cropping pat-\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n123\n\nterns, show better economic performance. Viewed from this perspective, similar are\nwater transfers and irrigation benefits from the major links from Mahanadi to\nGodavari to Krishna to Pennar and Cauvery in the peninsular component\n(Amarasinghe and Srinivasulu 2009). Although irrigation benefits of some of the\nindividual links are not financially attractive, the links taken together as a project\nmay prove financially attractive under a diversified cropping pattern.\nOf course, the above benefits are only direct and indirect financial benefits from\nirrigation. But, water infrastructure projects have other direct and indirect costs,\nincluding the cost of displacement of people\u2014resettlement and rehabilitation, and\nthe environmental impacts. The data on many of these aspects are scanty at best, and\nit is difficult to assess financial implications to complete a social cost and benefit of\nall links at present.\n\n7.5.4\n\nSocial Costs\n\nIt is likely that NRLP shall displace adivasi\u2019s and poor people on a massive scale.\nEstimates are sketchy, but the construction of reservoirs and canals in the peninsular\ncomponent alone is expected to displace more than 583,000 people, and submerge\nlarge areas of forest, agriculture and non-agricultural land. One estimate suggests\nthat the network of canals alone would displace about 5.5 million tribesmen and\nfarmers (Vombatkere 2003).\nMany critics of large water projects often focus only on negative impacts, multipurpose water transfers potentially can and do bring significant social benefits.\nRecent history of large-scale water resources projects in India and elsewhere, however, shows that despite government policies and procedures that include the necessary redress measures, displaced populations still suffer enormously. Such suffering\ncan be moderated or reduced but only though planned and sensitive resettlement\nand rehabilitation programs which India has generally failed to establish so far.\nSamad et al. (2009) shows that enhanced livelihood opportunities in relocation sites\ncan create longer-term benefits to compensate short-term losses.\nIn fact, many water transfer projects require both skilled and unskilled labor, and\nthe training provided for the local and sometimes for the regional or national workforce, is a major advantage for future endeavors. Often, large water development\nprojects increase access to new infrastructure: roads, which otherwise takes hours to\nreach to a decent mode of transport; markets, which otherwise are not even reachable for several days; clean water supply- without which people, especially women\nand children, trek hours to find a potable water source.\nThe large irrigation projects not only enhance the livelihood of the farming families in the command area, but also bring substantial multiplier effects to the region,\nand in some cases at the national level too (WCD 2000).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02c1f356-9310-4f8d-909d-8cf2cd5d9625": {"__data__": {"id_": "02c1f356-9310-4f8d-909d-8cf2cd5d9625", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9570319-8da3-4952-ba9b-49da24b677bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "036281e4a06b359858ce4087763ef5628a6d323f9987f31794046c517f1f8f57"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7fb2bfc-b995-4823-85b2-bab7f6f77eb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f58b8c046c3104d6bfb528b0a922965ee2119638ea183ed7c21e87de4c37344f"}}, "hash": "3cbc6095b6dec31678f9b581acba59d1e69261ce8c82e60ba5324af35fbb84fa", "text": "The Bhakra Irrigation\nProject\u2019s regional multiplier is 1.7 of the direct benefits (Bhatia et al. 2007).

Budgetary provisions made so far for water\ndevelopment are far from enough to complete ongoing projects. During recent\nyears, under a special \u2018Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Scheme\u2019, the government has\nbeen setting aside funds for the so-called \u2018last mile\u2019 projects(projects which are\nnearly complete but have been languishing for years for the lack of relatively modest funds to complete minor residual work).\nMany incomplete projects dot the country, to the extent that the NCIWRD estimated\nat the turn of the century that India needed US$ 15.5 billion (Rs. 70,000 crores) during\nthe Tenth Plan and US$ 24.4 billion (Rs. 110,000 crores) during the Eleventh Plan just\nto complete these \u2018last mile\u2019 projects. It is this fact that made senior researchers like\nIyer (2003) to quip, \u201cWe have had great difficulty in completing even single projects\nsuccessfully and we want to embark on 30 massive projects at the same time!\u201d\nThese concerns relate to the small versus large storage debate. It is clear that\nfreshwater storage at present is inadequate to address tomorrow\u2019s water needs. The\nsituation will be more acute with the pending climate change impacts. There is evidence that increasing storage only through a combination of large reservoirs, small\npond and tanks, soil moisture, groundwater aquifer and wet lands can bring the most\nsocio-economic benefits while reducing the environmental cost (Keller et al. 2000;\nMcCartney and Smakhtin 2010).\n\n7.5.6\n\nTrans-boundary Conflicts\n\nThere are trans-boundary issues of over-riding significance\u2014within India and outside\u2014when it comes to the actual implementation of NRLP. The Himalayan component is critically dependent on the agreement of neighboring countries Nepal and\nBhutan to the proposed construction, especially of dams, in their respective territories. Bangladesh, as a downstream riparian country, will be an affected party, and its\nconcerns need to be factored into the NRLP calculus. Under the India-Bangladesh\nTreaty of December 1996 on the sharing of Ganga waters, India has undertaken to\nprotect the flows arriving at Farakka, which is the sharing point. West Bengal has\nonly reluctantly agreed to the large allocations of waters to Bangladesh under the\nGanga Treaty and has been pressing the needs of Calcutta Port. On the other hand,\nBangladesh may feel threatened that a diversion of waters from the Ganga to the\nsouthern rivers will not be consistent with the sharing arrangement under the Treaty.\nMamata Banerjee, West Bengal\u2019s Chief Minister recently refused to share Teesta\n\n \n7\n\nRiver Linking Project: A Solution or Problem to India\u2019s Water Woes?\n\n125\n\nwaters with Bangladesh in an open show of defiance to Government of India\u2019s\nattempt to forge cooperation with Bengladesh. Inability of India to secure compliance from its own state governments weakens the scope for trans-boundary international cooperation even on a win-win formula.\nWater transfers between Brahmaputra and Ganga basins and from Ganga to other\nrivers may require modification of existing agreements or new treaties. Bhaduri and\nBarbier (2008) showed that India and Bangladesh could modify existing agreements to augment water supply, which in turn may benefit both countries. However,\nthis depends on the scale of political altruism India can muster to allocate water to\nthe downstream user or create some kind of insurance mechanisms to safeguard\nrights of the downstream riparian. If India decides unilaterally to transfer water to\npeninsular basins, or the States decide to use more than their share, Bangladesh\ncould incur huge environmental losses.\nExisting international agreements elsewhere provide many lessons relevant to\nthe NRLP (Gichuki and McCornick 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7fb2bfc-b995-4823-85b2-bab7f6f77eb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7fb2bfc-b995-4823-85b2-bab7f6f77eb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "02c1f356-9310-4f8d-909d-8cf2cd5d9625", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3cbc6095b6dec31678f9b581acba59d1e69261ce8c82e60ba5324af35fbb84fa"}, "3": {"node_id": "e136c517-c7c7-4212-9b3b-1c787a7d45de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b0cfa5f2d96834fddac318f28c7a4dfbef01784a4a41589f3e5259cfa178bbc"}}, "hash": "f58b8c046c3104d6bfb528b0a922965ee2119638ea183ed7c21e87de4c37344f", "text": "Initial agreements of water transfers are\nno longer functional in many inter-basin transfers, including those in the Aral Sea\nbasin among Central Asian Republics, in Tagus and Ebro basins in Spain. Many of\nthe conflicts arose later due to unforeseen circumstance at the planning stage. Often,\ninitial planning did not undertake a holistic analysis of t water supply and existing\nuses, and future demand in different countries or basins.\nWater transfers in the peninsular component too would hinge on inter-state politics, economics and agreements. Bihar may refuse to transfer Ganga water, as Lalu\nPrasad Yadav, a senior political leader of the State, argued that if her farmers are\nunable to use her water today, it does not mean they will remain unable to do so\nforever. But, such rejections could change if the recipient states compensate Bihar\nfor the Ganga waters that it allowed to transfer.\n\n7.6\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite the Supreme Court order, if the fate of NRLP were to depend upon the\nshape of the national debate around it, the dice are heavily loaded against it. This is\npartly due to intensely polarized ongoing debate based on plurality of prevailing\nconditions and experiences. The analyses of this paper have mixed conclusions. The\nproject is so large that it is difficult to conduct a holistic analysis leading to a social\ncost and benefits. The main reason for this is due to little information and data the\navailable in the public domain. The NCAER (2008) study has evaluated the macroeconomic benefits of the NRLP project, but lacked the environmental and socioeconomic cost.\nIt is possible that the present proposal for NRLP has come a decade or two too\nsoon. Many drivers and assumptions, which were conducive to the condition in the\n1990s, have changed since the proposal conception, and may change further before\nthe project undergoes feasibility analyses. Some of the changes are likely to create\nconditions favorable for a comprehensive solution of the kind of NRLP, although it\n\n \n126\n\nT. Shah and U.A. Amarasinghe\n\nis likely to be quite different in nature to the presently conceived form. In particular,\nthe following seven contingencies may be important in determining how the country\nwill plan its water infrastructure investments over the coming decade or two:\n1. Just as a cash-strapped China cold-stored Mao\u2019s proposal for transfers from\nSouth to North until the mid-1990s, a US$ 2 trillion Indian economy around\n2015 may take more enthusiastically to the idea of massive water infrastructure\ninvestment that amounts to more than what was invested under the current US$\n2 trillion Indian economy;\n2. Economy-wide demand for the improved performance of public systems in\ninfrastructure creation and management\u2014in road, railways, power, etc.,\u2014will\nalso restore public confidence in the water bureaucracies\u2019 capacity to deliver on\ntheir promises, and ease the prevailing opposition to \u2018sterile gigantisms\u2019;\n3. Similar economy-wide pressures to improve the rehabilitation of people affected\nby projects on roads, Special Economic Zones and such other dynamic infrastructure areas will raise the bar for resettlement and rehabilitation work in water\ninfrastructure projects, alleviating the other major concerns of civil society about\nlarge water projects;\n4. Increasing disposable incomes will prompt the \u2018median voter\u2019 to demand better\nwater services and pay for them, transforming extant water scarcity into \u2018economic\u2019 water scarcity; this will improve the financial viability and sustainability\nof water infrastructure; it will also mean water conflicts will be resolved through\nprice negotiations rather than through political bargaining or administrative\nprocesses;\n5. Similar pressures in agricultural water demand will arise due to intensive diversification of Indian agriculture that generates higher output-value per m3 of\nwater; diversification will create economic demand for more reliable, on-demand\nirrigation service for which the farmers will be willing to pay substantially more\nthan what they pay for canal irrigation today;\n6. Rising energy costs will make pump irrigation increasingly unattractive and\nincrease demand for surface water either for direct application to crops or for\ngroundwater recharge in western and peninsular India; rising costs of fossil fuel\nwill also make hydropower dams more attractive; and\n7. Finally, rapid growth in urban agglomerations will seriously strain their\ngroundwater-dependent water supply systems and that in turn will make interbasin water transfers for urban water needs economically viable and politically\ncompelling.\nIndia may or may not implement NRLP as proposed. However, there seems no\navoiding massive water infrastructure investments on a scale similar or even exceeding the NRLP.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e136c517-c7c7-4212-9b3b-1c787a7d45de": {"__data__": {"id_": "e136c517-c7c7-4212-9b3b-1c787a7d45de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7fb2bfc-b995-4823-85b2-bab7f6f77eb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f58b8c046c3104d6bfb528b0a922965ee2119638ea183ed7c21e87de4c37344f"}, "3": {"node_id": "262742d3-8959-47c8-84d9-3914159cb5ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7731683b66b5b7eed939b433ad0986a21ea826837bfe55bae80be8a7655727c1"}}, "hash": "7b0cfa5f2d96834fddac318f28c7a4dfbef01784a4a41589f3e5259cfa178bbc", "text": "Medium- to long-term water sector planning needs to take account of\nthe aforementioned seven contingencies.

In recent years, the pollution load discharged\nby different sectors (domestic, industrial and agriculture) has increased, some times\nbeyond the carrying/assimilative capacity of the environment. Fresh water sources\n(rivers, lakes and aquifers) are one of the major victims of pollution, whose impact\non health and livelihood of millions of poor people is critical, besides the physical\ndeterioration of the aquatic ecosystem. Hence, pollution hampers development in a\nsignificant manner. Though various pollution management measures have been\nattempted over a period of time, significant progress has not been achieved. In this\nregard, a more realistic and integrated approach (with emphasis on appropriate\nwater pollution policies, strict enforcement, multi-stakeholders\u2019 initiatives and\ncooperation, affordable technology development and application of economic\ninstruments) needs to be implemented.\nKeywords Water pollution \u2022 Integrated water resources management \u2022 Pollution\nmanagement \u2022 Water policy \u2022 Multi stakeholders analysis\n\n8.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe availability of good quality and adequate quantity of water is a pre-requisite for\nthe survival of all living organisms, smooth functioning of ecosystems, enhancing\ncommunities welfare and increasing their economic activities. However, freshwater\nsources have been threatened, sometimes in an irreversible manner in recent times,\nfrom various sources of pollution. The growing pollution of water sources is affecting the availability of safe water for various human uses. Besides, it causes environmental and health hazards, as well as a financial burden to community and\ngovernment.\n\nP.

Nelliyat\n\n\u201cWater Pollution is the degradation of water quality, as measured by biological,\nchemical or physical criteria that can make it unsuitable for desired uses, such as\nbathing, drinking or fishing, and can have serious effects on the health of humans\nand animals through contact or injection\u201d (Manson 2002). Pollution typically refers\nto chemicals or other harmful substances in concentrations greater than would occur\nunder natural conditions, to make the water unfit for use. Major water pollutants\ninclude microbes, nutrients, heavy metals, organic chemicals, oil and sediments.\nHeat, which raises the temperature of the receiving water, can also be a pollutant.\nWater pollution differs from nation to nation, with respect to the levels of economic\ndevelopment and pollution governance. Rapid industrial development, uncontrolled\nurbanization, intensive agriculture and aquaculture are the major causes of pollution\nin developing countries like India.\nWater pollution can broadly be categorized as: (a) Point source of pollution,\nwhich occurs when harmful substances are emitted directly into the water and land,\nand (b) Non-point source pollution, when pollutants are delivered indirectly through\ntransport or environmental change. Generally, the point source of pollution is easy\nto monitor and regulate, compared to non-point sources.\nWater pollution has severe impacts on the usefulness and value of water resources,\non ecosystems, fisheries, food production, health and social development, and economic activities. Water pollution can cause or aggravate tension and conflict, among\nvarious water users and even between countries (Kraemer et al. 2001). The rising\nwater pollution leads to the real and potential loss of the overall development opportunity in an economy like India, when the poor are affected seriously. This chapter\nexamines the water pollution scenario, its impacts, management efforts and integrated pollution management strategies in the context of India.\n\n8.2\n\nWater Pollution Scenario in India\n\nIndia possesses 17 % of the world\u2019s population, but has only 4 % of the world\u2019s\nrenewable water resources with 2.6 % of land area (MoWR 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "753e4a5a-07a9-441e-a257-ab95c43ea448": {"__data__": {"id_": "753e4a5a-07a9-441e-a257-ab95c43ea448", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a665014f-ad2d-4e9e-a605-be42bebe49e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "679e2e1f7cabb2970049b09ede86d35bd14c3bbec54fe85d4b83c74cd36f1d08"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ac8ce8b-088f-415b-b810-007b98cf173c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f500150ce36ce2d860514ba31ce00fe9beeec3c13375d0e77b5daff7a53b305"}}, "hash": "0a0f663c2125a9e77d324a1ecf1738e8840f7c2fca8092633561cc4e05293f7f", "text": "In India, the\npressure of economic development is changing the distribution patterns of water\nresources. The average availability of water is reducing steadily with the growing\npopulation, and it is estimated that by 2020, India will become a water stressed\nnation. There is no doubt that increasing fresh water contamination aggravates the\nsituation.\nIndia has been experiencing rapid urbanization and this rate has increased from\n10.84 % (1901) to 28.5 % (2001) and to 31.16 (2011). Most of our cities don\u2019t have\nproper schemes for the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of liquid\nand solid wastes. Besides, the expansion of peri-urban areas without adequate infrastructural services is an emerging challenge.\nAccording to Lundqvist et al. (2003), the entire population growth in the world\nduring the coming decades will virtually occur in or be confined to urban agglomerations, and most of it in less developed countries like India. India is experiencing\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n133\n\nstructural transformations, in terms of a decreasing role for agriculture, and the\nincreasing dominance of the industrial and service sectors, especially in urban areas.\nThe urban population is a heavy user of land and water resources. Hence, natural\nresources like wetlands, agricultural land, tanks and lakes, and the associated flora\nand fauna have been significantly lost. Moreover, waste (both solids and liquids)\ngenerated in urban and peri-urban areas is more concentrated, and hence, more serious in terms of environmental damage (Nelliyat and Ambujam 2011). In India, the\nurban population has increased from 11 % (1901) to 17 % (1951) and further to\n28 % (2001). Similarly, the number of towns has also increased from 1916 to 2422,\nto 4689, in these same respective years (Maiti and Agrawal 2005). Sanitation condition of the metro cities in India revealed that, almost universal flush toilet facility is\navailable in Mumbai followed by 90 % in Kolkata and 89 % in Delhi. However, the\nmatter of fact is that, more than half of this facility in Mumbai is available in a public place and not in house premises. Kolkata and Delhi might have a similar situation. Again it is unfortunate to note that about 9 % population of Kolkata and Delhi\nuses pit toilet. Further, what is the worst situation is that 9 % of Chennai\u2019s population does not have toilet facility at all followed by 6 % in Delhi (Maiti and Agrawal\n2005).\nThe study done by Nelliyat et al. (2012) revealed the magnitude of urbanization\nand its impacts on water sources in Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA). CMA comprises a total area of 1189 km2. It consists of Chennai city (176 km2), 16 Suburban\nMunicipalities (240 km2), 20 Town Panchayats (156 km2), and 216 Village\nPanchayats (617 km2). Chennai\u2019s growth has been rapid since the 1970s. Its population has increased from 3.5 million (1971) to 5.8 million (1991) to 9.8 million\n(2011) (CMDA 2007). Population projections based on the past trend showed that\nCMA would hold population of 12.6 million by 2026, of which Chennai city would\naccommodate only 5.8 million. Which means in future substantial urban growth\nwill occur in sub-urban part of the city. According to CMDA (2007), the sewerage\nsystem in Chennai city has covered 98 % of its area. The Corporation is collecting\nand disposing the solid wastes. However, the sewerage network and solid waste\nmanagement practices in the suburban areas are not satisfactory. The wastes are\ndisposed in the open lands and water bodies, which lead to high level contamination\nof fresh water sources and its consequences on human well-being are serious.\nAbout 29,000 million l/day (mld) of waste water is generated from India\u2019s class-I\ncities and class-II towns, out of which about 45 % (about 13,000 mld) is generated\nfrom 35 metro-cities alone. A collection system exists for only about 30 % of the\nwaste water through sewer lines, and the treatment capacity exists for about\n7000 mld (CPCB 2007). Thus, there is a large gap between the generation, collection and treatment of waste water. Most of the un-collected, un-treated waste water\nfinds its way to either nearby surface water bodies or cesspools.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ac8ce8b-088f-415b-b810-007b98cf173c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ac8ce8b-088f-415b-b810-007b98cf173c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "753e4a5a-07a9-441e-a257-ab95c43ea448", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a0f663c2125a9e77d324a1ecf1738e8840f7c2fca8092633561cc4e05293f7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1b439c5-a4fe-4849-a29f-1b5f87181b7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e75423cdf27548e1f97f3b047581eb92a06c6ffed8fb19d8630debe6ab8e43"}}, "hash": "0f500150ce36ce2d860514ba31ce00fe9beeec3c13375d0e77b5daff7a53b305", "text": "According to CAG (2011), only about 10 % of the waste water generated from\nthe domestic and industrial sectors in India is treated; the rest is discharged as it is\ninto water bodies and land. In almost all urban centres, cesspools exist, which are\nthe breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Further, the wastewater accumulated in cesspools gets percolated in to aquifers and pollutes the groundwater. Even now, our\n\n \n134\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\ncities have large numbers of conventional septic tanks and other low cost toilets,\nwhich contaminate the groundwater.\nThe industrial sector discharges around 30,730 million cubic meters of effluents,\nwithout proper treatment, into water bodies (CPCB 2006). For effluent treatment in\nthe small scale industrial sector under government initiatives, 88 Common Effluent\nTreatment Plants (CETP) were constructed, having a total capacity of 560 mld.\nThese plants would cover more than 10,000 small scale industries. But the study\ndone by the CPCB (2006) revealed that the common effluent treatment plants are\nnot performing satisfactorily, largely due to improper operation and maintenance.\nRun-off from agriculture fields is another major source of pollution as it contains\nfertilizers and pesticides. Fertilizer application in the country has increased substantially: from 305 metric tonnes (1959\u20131960) to 20,340 metric tonnes (2005\u20132006)\n(Khurana and Romit 2008). The use of pesticides has also increased from\n20,305 tonnes (1974) to 85,030 tonnes (1994) (Khurana and Romit 2008). Water\nquality is affected by frequent floods and droughts, and the over extraction of\ngroundwater, particularly in the coastal areas.\nIn certain parts of the country, groundwater quality degradation has occurred due\nto natural reasons. The natural chemical composition of groundwater is influenced\npredominantly by the type, depth of soils and subsurface geological formations\nthrough which groundwater passes. According to CGWB (2010) the behaviour of\ngroundwater in the Indian sub-continent is highly complicated, due to the occurrence of diversified geological formations with considerable lithological and chronological variations, complex tectonic framework, climatological dissimilarities and\nvarious hydro-chemical conditions. However, groundwater has become an important source of water for meeting the requirements of various sectors. It accounts for\nnearly 80 % of the rural and 50 % of the urban domestic water needs. Besides, well\nirrigation plays a significant role in increasing agricultural production. An aquifer is\ngenerally less susceptible to anthropogenic induced contamination and pollution\nwhen compared to surface water bodies. However, recently the trend has been\nchanging, and anthropogenic factors such as overexploitation of groundwater,\nexcessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, and improper disposal of\nurban/industrial waste, contaminate the groundwater. Nitrates, phosphates, and\nheavy metals in the groundwater lead to various health disorders.\nA recent study done by the CGWB (2010) through a network of about 15,500\ngroundwater samples indicated that well water in certain areas is found to have\nconcentrations beyond permissible limits of some constituents, and is not fit for\nhuman consumption. The study results are summarised below.\nTotal Dissolved Solids \u2013 TDS \u2013 (Salinity) is the saltiness or dissolved salt content\nthat exists in groundwater. It is mostly influenced by aquifer material, solubility of\nminerals, duration of contact and factors such as the permeability of the soil, drainage facilities, quantity of rainfall and above all, the climate of the area. The salinity\nof the groundwater in coastal areas may be due to air borne salts, originating from\nthe air water interface over the sea, and also due to over pumping of fresh water\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n135\n\nwhich overlays saline water in coastal aquifer systems. The Bureau of Indian\nStandards (BIS) has recommended a drinking water standard of a limit of 500 mg/l\nfor TDS, which can be extended to 2000 mg/l in the case of no alternative source.\nBut water having TDS of more than 2000 mg/l is not suitable for drinking. This is\nobserved in some districts of Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal\nPradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab,\nRajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\nChloride is highly soluble in water and moves freely through soil and rock.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1b439c5-a4fe-4849-a29f-1b5f87181b7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1b439c5-a4fe-4849-a29f-1b5f87181b7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ac8ce8b-088f-415b-b810-007b98cf173c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f500150ce36ce2d860514ba31ce00fe9beeec3c13375d0e77b5daff7a53b305"}, "3": {"node_id": "08ee7147-0a9d-47cd-88fb-39410bd5b6af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "908341df3dd010394320433c08a4657a95b682b1067abffc769227b76b3934f4"}}, "hash": "71e75423cdf27548e1f97f3b047581eb92a06c6ffed8fb19d8630debe6ab8e43", "text": "Chloride is highly soluble in water and moves freely through soil and rock. In\ngroundwater, the chloride content is mostly below 250 mg/l, except in cases where\ninland salinity is prevalent and in coastal areas. The BIS has recommended a desirable limit of 250 mg/l of chloride in drinking water. This concentration limit can be\nextended to 1000 mg/l in case no alternative source of water is available. However,\ngroundwater having concentrations of more than 1000 mg/l of chloride is not suitable for drinking purposes. This is observed in some districts in Andhra Pradesh,\nDelhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab,\nRajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\nFluoride Most of the fluoride found in groundwater is naturally drawn from the\nbreakdown of rocks and soils or weathering and deposition of atmospheric particles.\nThe occurrence of fluoride in natural water is affected by the type of rocks, climatic\nconditions, nature of hydrogeological strata and time of contact between the rock\nand the circulating groundwater. The presence of other ions, particularly bicarbonate and calcium ions, also affects the concentration of fluoride in the groundwater.\nSmall amounts of fluoride (less than 1.0 mg/l) have proven to be beneficial in reducing tooth decay. However, high concentrations (1.5 mg/l and above) have resulted in\nstaining of teeth. The BIS has recommended an upper desirable limit of 1.0 mg/l of\nfluoride in drinking water, which can be extended to 1.5 mg/l if no alternative source\nof water is available. But fluoride concentrations of more than 1.5 mg/l in water\nmake it un-suitable for drinking purposes. This is observed in some districts of\nAndhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh,\nHaryana, Orissa, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Delhi,\nJharkhand, Maharashtra, and Assam.\nIron is a common constituent in soil and groundwater. It is present in water either\nas soluble ferrous iron or insoluble ferric iron. The concentration of iron in natural\nwater is controlled by both physio-chemical and microbiological factors. It seeps\ninto groundwater mainly from the weathering of ferruginous minerals of igneous\nrocks, such as hematite, magnetite and sulphide ores of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The permissible iron concentration in groundwater is less than 1.0 mg/l\nas per the BIS for drinking water. Excessive iron has been found in some districts of\nAndhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand,\nKarnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa,\nPunjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andaman\n& Nicobar Island.\n\n \n136\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\nArsenic Arsenic is a trace element found in rocks, soils, and the water in contact\nwith them. Arsenic has been recognized as a toxic element and is considered a\nhuman health hazard. The occurrence of arsenic is mainly in the aquifers up to\n100 m depth, but deeper aquifers are free from contamination. As per the BIS for\ndrinking water, the maximum permissible limit of arsenic concentration in groundwater is 0.01 mg/l. Arsenic contamination has been found in the states of West\nBengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Chhattisgarh.\nNitrate is a naturally occurring compound that is formed in the soil when nitrogen\nand oxygen combine. The primary source of all nitrates is atmospheric nitrogen gas.\nThis is converted into organic nitrogen by some plants by a process called nitrogen\nfixation. Dissolved Nitrogen (Nitrate) is the most common contaminant of groundwater, and generally originates from non-point sources, such as leaching of chemical fertilizers & animal manure, groundwater pollution from septic and sewage\ndischarges, etc. It is difficult to identify the natural and manmade sources of nitrogen contamination. Some chemical and micro-biological processes such as nitrification and de-nitrification also influence the nitrate concentration. As per the BIS for\ndrinking water the maximum desirable limit of nitrate concentration is 45 mg/l.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08ee7147-0a9d-47cd-88fb-39410bd5b6af": {"__data__": {"id_": "08ee7147-0a9d-47cd-88fb-39410bd5b6af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1b439c5-a4fe-4849-a29f-1b5f87181b7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e75423cdf27548e1f97f3b047581eb92a06c6ffed8fb19d8630debe6ab8e43"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6598abf-89fa-46b8-8bf0-25dae8487908", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "802250d1f5d5d8cfb05df61818868fe0beff983bd3f2d9445805acc5cb749dd9"}}, "hash": "908341df3dd010394320433c08a4657a95b682b1067abffc769227b76b3934f4", "text": "Though nitrate is considered relatively non-toxic, a high concentration in drinking\nwater is of great concern because of increased risks of matheomoglobinemia\n(Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that contains ferric iron and has a\ndecreased ability to bind oxygen), particularly to infants. Excess concentration of\nNitrate in groundwater has been observed in most of the states.\n\n8.3\n\nImpacts of Pollution\n\nPollution is an \u2018externality\u2019 issue and its impacts on human health and wellbeing are\ncritical. The state of human health is inextricably linked to a range of water related\nconditions: safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, minimized burden of water\nrelated diseases and healthy freshwater ecosystems (WHO 2003). Water conveys\nmicro-organisms, and chemical pollutants, and is a source of radiological risks.\nPollutants are directly transferred to the human body through drinking water, and\nindirectly to the water applied to food crops and livestock, fish, etc., and through\naerosols generated by air conditioning systems. Aquatic ecosystems serve as breeding habitats for insect vectors of diseases, and for snails that serve as intermediate\nhosts in the transmission cycle of certain parasitic diseases. When the pollution load\nincreases in fresh water sources, millions of people are at risk (Nelliyat 2011).\nFurther pollution will increase the financial burden of local bodies through incremental costs for pure water supply.\nHistorically, rural settlements managed their drinking water requirement through\nlocal sources, and quality issues did not emerge except in a few habitats due to\ngeogenic reasons. However, the level of pollution has increased in recent times due\nto various anthropogenic reasons. Our country is also characterised by non-unifor-\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n137\n\nmity in the level of awareness, socio-economic development, education, poverty,\npractices and rituals which add to the complexity of providing water (Khurana and\nRomit 2008). Even if the government has undertaken various drinking water programmes with huge expenditure over a period, many rural settlements still lack safe\nand secure drinking water.\nBacterial contamination of water continues to be a widespread problem across\nthe country, and is a major cause of health problems. During 2005, the CPCB conducted a detailed water quality analysis, and the results indicated that organic pollution (BOD and coliform) continues to be predominant in aquatic resources. It was\nobserved that nearly 66 % of the samples had BOD values less than the acceptable\nlimits and 44 % of the samples indicated the presence of coliform. About 70\u201380 %\nof water borne diseases in India are caused by the discharge of untreated/partially\ntreated sewage and industrial effluents into water bodies. The health costs of water\npollution are enormous. Annually 37.7 million Indians are affected by water diseases, including the loss of 75 million working days (Khurana and Romit 2008).\nAround 1.5 million children die of diarrhoea alone (Khurana and Romit 2008).\nIn India, the cost of inaction or the estimated overall environmental damage cost\nfrom pollution was $9.7 billion/year or 4.5 % of GDP in 1992. Out of the total damage cost, the health impact of water pollution was estimated to be US$5710 million\n(59 %) (Brandon and Hommann 1995). Water related diseases impose burdens on\nboth the household\u2019s and the nation\u2019s economy. At the household level, the economic loss includes cost of treatment, and wage loss during sickness. Loss of working days affects national productivity. Besides, the government also spends huge\nmoney on treatment of the sick and in providing other supporting services. According\nto a Government of India estimate, the expenditure on health care adds up to Rs.\n6700 crore (Rs. 60 per head) annually.\nPollution impacts on ecosystems (biodiversity) and various economic activities\nlike agriculture, livestock, fisheries etc., are also of concern. The study done by\nNelliyat (2012) revealed the various impacts of untreated/partially treated textile\neffluent discharge in a South Indian river basin (Noyyal). Since the groundwater and\nsurface water sources are not suitable for cultivation, farmers incur heavy losses.\nMost of the saline sensitive crops have disappeared from the basin and the productivity of the existing crops has reduced. Water contamination has also affected the\ndomestic water sector, and households are purchasing or fetching fresh water from\ndistant sources. Since all the surface water sources are highly polluted, biodiversity\nand fisheries are affected, and fishermen have lost their livelihood options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6598abf-89fa-46b8-8bf0-25dae8487908": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6598abf-89fa-46b8-8bf0-25dae8487908", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "08ee7147-0a9d-47cd-88fb-39410bd5b6af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "908341df3dd010394320433c08a4657a95b682b1067abffc769227b76b3934f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "d838d6a7-294d-41d5-9cb4-a68417837269", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c92b9ad97ac0532bfcdc0c7ff7cb8a98aaf7d3b8da6ac1c3b78117f03120ab2b"}}, "hash": "802250d1f5d5d8cfb05df61818868fe0beff983bd3f2d9445805acc5cb749dd9", "text": "Industries\nare also bringing their required water from the non-polluted/distant areas through\ntankers or pipelines.

India has 7500 km of coast line. A number of urban\nsettlements, including mega cities and industries are located on the coast.

Municipal/domestic wastes reduce the dissolved oxygen (DO),\nincrease hydrogen sulphide, BOD and faecal coliform. Industrial waste affects the\nDO, temperature, turbidity, pH and increases the BOD, COD, and suspended solids.\nCoastal areas are experiencing overexploitation of groundwater. Seawater intrusion\ninduced contamination of the aquifer is a major challenge to freshwater security in\ncoastal areas of the country (Nelliyat et al. 2009). Further, the intensive aqua-cultural practice in coastal villages has led to salinization of the groundwater.\nCoastal cities in India are under the looming threat of pollution. The type and\nquantum of pollutants into the coastal ecosystem of India are given in Table 8.1.\nIn Mumbai, the river Kalu flowing through the industrial towns of Ambarnath,\nUlhasnagar and Kalyan has a mercury concentration exceeding 100 ppm. Thana\ncreek receives effluents of over 50 MLD where high mercury levels are present in\nthe water, sediments and living organisms. In Calcutta the Hoogly river carries\neffluents that have contaminated fish and shell fish with heavy metals such as Ni,\nCu, Cd and Zn. The sediments near Haldia have up to 10 ug/g of pesticides. These\nriver waters are contaminated by e-coli, shigella, salmonella and other human\npathogens \u2013 indication of severe sewage contamination. In Kochi, the Periyar\nriver receives effluents from chemical industries and untreated sewage. Incidents\nof ulsuration in shrimp and fish, and frequent fish mortality have affected traditional fishing. In Goa, estuarine and coastal waters are \u201cclean\u201d, though there is\nhigh sediment load from mining activities. The Mandovi-Zuari estuaries receive\nover 30 MLD of partly treated domestic sewage and 15 MLD of industrial effluents (Elrich 2013).\nThe study by Palanisamy et al. (2006) indicated that the levels of hydrological\npollution of Chennai coastal zone have been increased in the recent years by an\nuncontrolled disposal of wastewater and pollutants due to human activities.

For example,\nwhen traditional drinking water sources get contaminated, the rich can buy packaged water. But the poor are not able to pay, and hence are compelled to use the\npolluted water.\n\n8.4\n\nPollution Management\n\nHistorically, the municipalities and such civic authorities have been responsible for\nmanagement of the wastes in cities. However, in recent periods due to various reasons (including erosion of authority, inability to raise revenues and inadequate managerial capabilities) urban bodies have not been able to cope with this massive task.\nThat is why, it became necessary to launch special programmes like the Ganga\nAction Plan and subsequently the National River Conservation Plan, which are\nessentially addressed to the task of trapping, diverting and treating municipal wastewater (CPCB 2007).\nIndia has a long tradition of institutions in water resources management, which\nis seen from its ancient culture to the modern legislative devices. Ancient Indian\nreligious literature (Vedas, Upanishads, Smiritis and Dharmas) preached a worshipful attitude towards earth and its elements including water and enshrined a respect\nfor nature and environmental harmony and conservation (Sankar 1998). During the\nBritish period, too environmental (water pollution) issues garnered attention\nthrough:\n(a) The Indian Penal Code 1860, that contains one chapter (Chapter XIV) on\noffences affecting public health, safety, convenience, decency and morals.\n(b) The Indian Easement Act of 1882, that guaranteed property rights of riparian\nowners against \u201cunreasonable\u201d pollution by upstream users.\n(c) The Shore Nuisance (Bombay-Kalova) Act, 1893, that was enacted to check\nwastes and marine water pollution.\n(d) The Municipal and Public Health Acts on the pattern of Local Authorities Act\nof United Kingdom, conferred powers on the local bodies for controlling water\npollution caused by industrial effluents and for necessary action against the erring industries. Further it prohibits the discharge of any pollutant or trade effluent from factories into municipal drains, and the discharge of sewage into any\nwatercourse until it had been treated, so as not to contaminate the water (Sankar\n1998).\n\n \n140\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\nIn the Indian Constitution, environmental protection has been emphasized. The\nRiver Boards Act, 1956 is an important legislation enacted by the Parliament.\nFurther the 42nd Constitution Amendment Act, 1976, inserted specific provisions\nfor environmental protection in the form of Directive Principles of State Policy and\nFundamental Duties. Article 51A (g) was envisaged to protect and improve the\nnatural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures. For water pollution management, various initiatives have\nbeen taken by the government (Table 8.2).\n\n8.4.1\n\nLegislative Framework\n\nThe goal of compliance with environmental laws is to assure the average citizen,\nthat natural resources are protected, that specific violators can be identified, and that\nthey comply with legal provisions. This is needed in order to safeguard human\nhealth and the environment and to deter future violations (CAG 2011). The main\nlegal provisions with regard to the prevention of water pollution in India are as\nfollows:\nWater (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act: 1974 was the first environmental law enacted by Parliament.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c86f99f6-d67e-466a-8e16-33da9666d7da": {"__data__": {"id_": "c86f99f6-d67e-466a-8e16-33da9666d7da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d838d6a7-294d-41d5-9cb4-a68417837269", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c92b9ad97ac0532bfcdc0c7ff7cb8a98aaf7d3b8da6ac1c3b78117f03120ab2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "39fa0aaf-b687-434b-97de-de9e45d7cf60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5862953b8c8aa5803f9715cc6bc3b5866c4eda2c7e4b7a202f5c8ac47aa6625d"}}, "hash": "7467a2d1ecf4815db1f8011454201d301f9f25713990381c5cfa6c645ca3dfa1", "text": "It defines pollution as \u2018such contamination of\nwater or such alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of water\non such discharge of any sewage or trade effluent or of any other liquid, gaseous or\nsolid substance into water (whether directly or indirectly) as may, or is likely to\n\nTable 8.2 Water pollution management efforts\nLegislation\n\u2666Water (Prevention\nand Control of\nPollution) Act,1974\n\u2666Water (Prevention\nand Control of\nPollution) Rules, 1975\n\u2666The water\n(Prevention and\nControl of Pollution)\nCess Act, 1977\n\u2666Environment\n(Protection) Act, 1986\n\u2666Environment\n(Protection) Rules\n1986\n\nPolicy\n\u2666National Water\nPolicy, 2002\n\u2666National\nEnvironment\nPolicy, 2006\n\u2666Draft National\nWater Policy, 2012\n\nProgrammes\n\u2666Ganga Action Plan\n\u2666National River\nConservation Plan\n\u2666National Lake\nConservation Plan\n\u2666Jawaharlal Nehru\nNational Urban\nRenewal Mission\n\u2666Urban Infrastructure\n\u2666Development\nScheme for Small and\nMedium Towns\n\nIndustrial water\npollution (SSIs)\n\u2666Closure Policy\n\u2666Waste Minimization\n\u2666Common Effluent\nTreatment Plants\n(CETPs)\n\u2666Relocation strategy\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n141\n\ncreate a nuisance or render such water harmful or injurious to public health or\nsafety, or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or other legitimate uses,\nor to the life and health of animals or of aquatic organisms\u2019. The Act provides for\nthe prevention and control of water pollution and for maintaining or restoring the\nwholesomeness of water in the country. To achieve this objective, the Act provided\nfor establishing the Pollution Control Board (PCB) at the central and state levels. It\nlays down a system of consent, whereby no industry or operator process or any\ntreatment and disposal system can be established without the prior consent of the\nstate Board. Similarly, no industry/process can discharge sewage or trade effluents\ninto a stream or well/sewer/land in excess of the standards. Contravention of the\nprovisions of this Act is punishable in monetary as well as non-monetary terms.\nThe Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 provides for\nthe levy of cess on the use of water by various users, i.e., industry and local authorities which are entrusted with the duty of supplying water under the law. This cess\nwas meant to augment the funds required by the state PCB for their effective functioning, in the discharge of duties under the Act. The cess is collected by the state\ngovernment concerned, and paid to the central government. The proceeds are\ncredited to the consolidated fund of India. The central government, after due appropriation made by Parliament by Law, disburses such sums of money as it may think\nfit to the central and state Boards, having regard to the amount of cess collected by\nthe state government concerned.\nEnvironment (Protection) Act, 1986 was enacted in the aftermath of the Bhopal\ngas tragedy in 1984; it also refers to the decisions taken at the Stockholm Conference\nin 1972, and expresses concern about the decline in environmental quality, increasing pollution, loss of vegetal cover and biological diversity, excessive concentrations of harmful chemicals in the ambient atmosphere, growing risks of environmental\naccidents, and threats to life systems. The Act is a comprehensive piece of legislation and under this, the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) was announced. The\nnodal agency for implementing various legislations relating to environmental protection at the centre is the MoEF. It is expected to provide directions to the CPCB\non matters relating to the prevention and control of pollution, and design and implement a wide range of programmes relating to environmental protection.\nSubsequently, different standards were set for emission and effluent discharge.\nUnder EPR 1986, the Government of India notified in 1993, that the emission or\ndischarge of environmental pollutants from industries, operations or processes shall\nnot exceed the relevant parameters and standards specified. The general standards\nfor the discharge of effluents cover more than 40 parameters, including colour and\nodour, suspended solids, dissolved solids, pH, BOD, COD, chemicals and metals.\nThe permissible limits vary depending on where the effluents are discharged, viz.,\ninland water surface, public sewers, land for irrigation, and marine coastal areas.\nThese standards are based on concentrations of pollutants per unit of effluent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39fa0aaf-b687-434b-97de-de9e45d7cf60": {"__data__": {"id_": "39fa0aaf-b687-434b-97de-de9e45d7cf60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c86f99f6-d67e-466a-8e16-33da9666d7da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7467a2d1ecf4815db1f8011454201d301f9f25713990381c5cfa6c645ca3dfa1"}, "3": {"node_id": "46d53677-861e-4361-afa6-3abdbf07b692", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "333924a078188639541407b57180d92b8ac9e3795bcdede44867936e4c7be523"}}, "hash": "5862953b8c8aa5803f9715cc6bc3b5866c4eda2c7e4b7a202f5c8ac47aa6625d", "text": "These standards are based on concentrations of pollutants per unit of effluent.\n\n \n142\n\n8.4.2\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\nPolicy Framework\n\nBesides the legal framework described above, the following policy provisions\naddress the issues of water pollution in India:\nThe National Water Policy (NWP) adopted in 1987, was reviewed and updated\nby the MoWR in 2002. This policy aimed at meeting the challenges that have\nemerged in the development and management of water resources, including water\npollution. The policy emphasizes that:\n(a) Both surface water and groundwater quality should be regularly monitored\n(b) Effluents should be treated as per standards before being discharged.\n(c) Principle of \u2018polluter pays\u2019 should be followed.\n(d) Necessary legislation should be made for preservation of water bodies from\nencroachment and deterioration.\n(e) New techniques should be followed to eliminate pollution and\n(f) Waste water should be recycled and reused.\nThe MoWR 2002 envisaged that in a time bound manner, (a period of 2 years)\nthe states would frame and adopt the respective state water policies (MoWR 2002).\nNational Environment Policy, 2006 enacted by the MoEF, deals with water quality pointing out that improvement in the existing strategies and innovations are\nneeded to eliminate the pollution of surface and groundwater resources. It also\nstates that resources should be conserved, and water availability augmented by maximising retention, eliminating pollution and minimising losses. The policy emphasized the need:\n(a) To develop and implement, public-private partnership models for setting up and\noperating treatment plants.\n(b) To prepare and implement action plans for major cities for water pollution,\nthrough regulatory as well as incentive based instruments.\n(c) To take measures to prevent pollution of water bodies from sources, especially\nwaste disposal on lands.\n(d) To enhance spatial planning with adequate participation by local communities,\nto ensure clustering of polluting industries, and to facilitate setting up of CETPs.\n(e) To promote R&D in development of low cost treatment technologies at different scales.\n(f) To manage pollution through pricing policies of agricultural inputs, especially\npesticides and dissemination of agronomy practices.\nDraft National Water Policy, 2012 indicated that \u201caccess to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation should be regarded as a right to life essential to the full\nenjoyment of life and all other human rights\u201d (MoWR 2012 page no 5). The policy\nemphasised the following:\n(a) Recycle and reuse of waste water and de-salinization.\n(b) Urban water supply and sewage treatment schemes should be integrated and\nexecuted through proper pricing policy.\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n143\n\n(c) Industries in water short regions should be allowed to either withdraw only the\nmake up water or should have an obligation to return treated effluent to a specified standard back to the hydrologic system.\n(d) Subsidies and incentives should be implemented to encourage recovery of\nindustrial pollutants and recycling/reuse, which are otherwise capital\nintensive.\n(e) Industrial effluents, local cess pools, residues of fertilizers and chemicals, etc.,\nshould not reach the groundwater as cleaning is complex.\n\n8.4.3\n\nProgrammes\n\nGanga Action Plan (GAP) is a pioneer comprehensive attempt to address pollution at the river basin level. The Ganga originates from the Gangotri Glacier in the\nGarhwal Himalayas, and traversing a distance of 2525 km, flows into the Bay of\nBengal at Ganga Sagar in West Bengal. The Ganga basin (861,404 km2) is the largest river basin in India, and covers approximately 25 % of the country\u2019s total geographical area, and caters to about 40 % of the population. The utilizable water is\naround 30 % of India\u2019s total usable water from major river basins (ERI 2011).\nDuring the course of its journey, municipal sewage from 29 Class-I cities (population >1,00,000), 23 Class II cities (population between 50,000 and 1,00,000) and\nabout 48 towns, effluents from a number of industries, and pollutants from nonpoint sources, are discharged into the river (MoEF 2004). The average population\ndensity of the Ganga basin is 520 persons/km2, while the national average is 325.\nMajor cities, including Delhi, Kolkata, Kanpur, Lucknow, Patna, Agra, Meerut,\nVaranasi, and Allahabad, are situated in the basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46d53677-861e-4361-afa6-3abdbf07b692": {"__data__": {"id_": "46d53677-861e-4361-afa6-3abdbf07b692", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "39fa0aaf-b687-434b-97de-de9e45d7cf60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5862953b8c8aa5803f9715cc6bc3b5866c4eda2c7e4b7a202f5c8ac47aa6625d"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8c31a0c-317c-4645-bdb9-5b961b067472", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "103e7b29756f5c0deb88eb16f6271e3284fa22fdf06ab38e124c28b76bd84cb7"}}, "hash": "333924a078188639541407b57180d92b8ac9e3795bcdede44867936e4c7be523", "text": "These cities have large and growing populations, and a rapidly expanding industrial base (Vinod 2011).

For implementation of the GAP, the Government\nof India constituted the Central Ganga Authority, under the chairmanship of the\nPrime Minister in 1985.\nAt the time of launching, the main objective of the GAP was to improve the\nwater quality of the Ganga to acceptable standards by preventing the pollution load\nreaching the river. The objective of the GAP was, however, recast in 1987, restricting it to include only the restoration of the river water quality to the \u201cBathing class\u201d\nstandard (Dissolved Oxygen \u2013 Not less than 5 mg/l, Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand \u2013\nNot more than 3 mg/l, Bacterial Load/Coliform Count \u2013 Not more than 10,000 per\nml, Faecal Coliform \u2013 Not more than 2500 per 100 ml and pH \u2013 6.5 to 8.5) (MoEF\n2004). The GAP emphasized the \u2018interception and diversion of wastewater and its\ntreatment in Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), before discharging into river\u2019. For\nimplementing the plan a comprehensive institutional arrangement was created at\ndifferent levels. The allotted money by the Government of India for the first stage of\n\n \n144\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\nGAP (1985\u20131992) was Rs. 451.70 crore. Until recently, an amount of Rs. 1612.38\ncrores has been spent on the second stage (MoEF 2004; ERI 2011).\nAccording to Vinod (2011) GAP is one of the longest and ambitious government\ninterventions, which has significantly influenced policies for controlling water pollution in India. However, GAP has been criticized on many fronts: inordinate delays\nin implementation, irregular release of funds, confusions over roles of institutions,\nweak monitoring, inadequacy of standards for assessing water-quality, irregular and\ninadequate operation and maintenance of the assets, political motivations, \u2018quality\u2019\nand \u2018purity\u2019 of the Ganga water, etc. (Ahmed 1990; Divan 1995; Alley 1994; Vinod\n2011). The Central Government itself has accepted that despite having spent more\nthan 2500 crores of rupees on abatement of the pollution of the Ganga in the earlier\nphases, it has not been quite effective (Vinod 2011).\nNational River Conservation Programme (NRCP) The GAP has generated considerable interest, and set the scene for evolving a national approach towards replicating this program \u2013 NRCP \u2013 for the other polluted rivers of the country. After the\ncompletion of GAP-I, the programe of river clearing was extended to other major\nrivers of the country under two separate schemes (GAP-Phase II and NRCP). The\nYamuna and Gomati Action Plans were approved in 1993 under GAP-II, while\nother major rivers were subsequently approved in 1995 under the NRCP, covering\n190 towns and 39 rivers in 20 states. So far Rs. 4302.43 crores (including state government share) has been spent under this programme. The pollution load to be tackled has been estimated as 4906.53 mld (MoEF 2012a).\nNational Lake Conservation Programme (NLCP) Lakes are valuable ecosystems and provide a range of goods and services to humankind. They act as livelihood sources (irrigation, fisheries, washing) for millions of poor people. They are\nsources of fresh water and serve as habitat to many plants and animals. Lakes can\nmoderate hydrological events, such as drought and floods, influence the microclimate and enhance the aesthetic beauty of the landscape. However, in recent times,\nrapid urbanization and degradation of catchments have resulted in the deterioration\nof lakes (decline in water quality, loss of biodiversity, eutrophication, encroachment, siltation and shrinkage). Recognizing the importance of lakes, particularly\nurban ones, the MoEF launched an NLCP in 2001, exclusively aimed at restoring\nthe lakes in different parts of the country. The objective of the scheme is to \u201crestore\nand conserve the urban and semi-urban lakes of the country, degraded due to waste\nwater discharge into the lake and other unique freshwater eco-systems, through an\nintegrated ecosystem approach\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8c31a0c-317c-4645-bdb9-5b961b067472": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8c31a0c-317c-4645-bdb9-5b961b067472", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "46d53677-861e-4361-afa6-3abdbf07b692", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "333924a078188639541407b57180d92b8ac9e3795bcdede44867936e4c7be523"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f013180-d408-46a1-9360-0186454f8def", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaa2a967e89e0fec53b79e49f140165b1714c7a2aec28dd3008bfcac71d0c41d"}}, "hash": "103e7b29756f5c0deb88eb16f6271e3284fa22fdf06ab38e124c28b76bd84cb7", "text": "The scheme operates on a funding pattern of 70:30\ncosts sharing option between the Central and the participating State Governments.\nFourty-four lakes were included in this programme and the total cost was Rs.\n1028.19 crores.\nActivities covered under the NLCP are: (a) the prevention of pollution from\npoint sources by intercepting, diverting and treating the pollution loads, (b) in situ\nmeasures such as de-silting, de-weeding, bio-remediation, aeration, biomanipulation, nutrient reduction etc. with the help of successfully tested ecotechnologies depending upon the site conditions, (c) catchments area treatment\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n145\n\ninclude forestation, storm water drainage, silt traps etc., (d) strengthening of bund,\nlake fencing, shoreline development etc., (e) lake front eco-development including\npublic interface, (f) solid waste management, prevention of pollution from nonpoint sources by providing low cost sanitation, and (g) public awareness and public\nparticipation, capacity building, training and research in the area of Lake\nConservation, and any other activity depending upon specific location (MoEF\n2012b).\nJawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) The tremendous increase in urban population over the last two decades resulted in acute infrastructural deficiencies, including sanitation and solid waste management. With this\nconsideration the Government of India estimated that over a 7 year period, (starting\nfrom 2005 to 2006) the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) required a total investment of\nRs. 120,536 crores (Rs. 17,219 crores annually) for infrastructure development.\nTotally 63 cities are included in this programme (7 mega cities with a population of\nmore than 4 million, 28 medium cities with populations between 1 and 4 million and\n28 small cities with less than 1 million population).\nUrban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns\n(UIDSSMT) was launched in 2005 for improving the infrastructure in towns and\nhelping create durable public assets and quality oriented services in cities & towns,\nenhance public-private-partnership in infrastructural development and, promote the\nplanned integrated development of towns and cities. The targeted duration of the\nscheme was 7 years from 2005 to 2006. The scheme would apply to all cities/towns\nnot included under JNNURM. The components of the scheme covered all urban\ninfrastructure developmental projects, including water supply, sewerage, solid\nwaste management and preservation of water bodies.

The National\nProductivity Council estimated that SSIs were responsible for 65 % of industrial\npollution and 40 % of waste generation (Yadav 2002). In India, the enforcement\nagencies have adopted a policy of \u2018closure\u2019, but its negative impacts on production\nand employment are critical. Then the MoEF in collaboration with the World\nBank launched a project for \u2018waste minimization\u2019 in the late 1990s. 45 waste\nminimization circles were set up in various sectors in different parts of the country.\nUnfortunately, the project has not been successful in achieving its objectives.\n\n \n146\n\nP.

Besides, the CETPs could minimize the treatment cost and also the\nproblem of technical know-how. During 1990\u20132000, more than 90 CETP projects\nwere approved in India, with financial assistance from different agencies, including\nthe World Bank. But now, the CETPs are facing a big problem with the operating/\nrunning costs, and industrialists are unwilling to share the cost, which ultimately\nhas seriously affected the efficient functioning of the plants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f013180-d408-46a1-9360-0186454f8def": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f013180-d408-46a1-9360-0186454f8def", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8c31a0c-317c-4645-bdb9-5b961b067472", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "103e7b29756f5c0deb88eb16f6271e3284fa22fdf06ab38e124c28b76bd84cb7"}, "3": {"node_id": "71fee620-0c1f-4e18-a8e1-be5347129f89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f51ed2e30fc002951d0ff55f7412f1cbbcae533766e17d8092c4279ba15bb0aa"}}, "hash": "aaa2a967e89e0fec53b79e49f140165b1714c7a2aec28dd3008bfcac71d0c41d", "text": "The \u2018relocation strategy\u2019 is another strategy widely discussed and some felt that this is the only solution\nto solve the SSIs\u2019 pollution problem in urban areas.

But experience shows that the relocation of units simply means relocation of pollution (Gupt 2003).\n\n8.5\n\nWater Pollution Control Efforts: Emerging Lessons\n\nRiver cleaning and control of pollution programmes for our polluted rivers are being\nimplemented since 1985. The programmes seek to address pollution from point and\nnon-point sources, through the construction of STPs, low cost sanitation, electric\ncrematoria etc. However, the data on the results of these programmes are not very\nencouraging. The Ganga in certain stretches, Yamuna, Gomti, Godavari, Musi,\nCauvery, Cooum, Mahananda, Khan, Kshipra, Vaigai, Chambal, Rani Chu,\nMandovi, Sabarmati, Subarnarekha, Tungabhadra, Pennar, Pamba, Betwa, Krishna,\nSutlej etc., continue to be plagued by high levels of organic pollution, low level of\noxygen availability for aquatic organisms and bacteria, protozoa and viruses, which\nhave faecal-origin and cause illnesses (CAG 2011).\nMost lakes in India are under threat from nutrient overloading, which is causing\ntheir eutrophication and eventual choking up by the weeds proliferating in the\nnutrient-rich water. The implementation of NLCP in conserving these lakes has had\nno discernible effect. Pichola, Pushkar, Dimsagar, Banjara, Kotekere, Bellandur, Veli\nAkkulam, Shivpuri, Powai, Rankala, Twin lakes, Bindusagar, Mansagar, Mansiganga,\nRabindra Sarovar, Mirik, Kodaikanal lake, Dal lake, Durgabari lake, Laxminarayanbari\nLake, Dimsagar Lake etc., have shown poor water quality. However, there have been\nsome success stories like Nainital lake, Kotekere lake, Sharanabasaveshwara lake\nand Mansagar, where the water quality has improved after completion of conservation programmes (CAG 2011). Even if various strategies have been introduced for\npollution management in the industrial sector, notable achievement has not been\nattained. Still industries play a significant role in water pollution.\nEven if India has a strong historical heritage in water resource management\nbounded with culture and legislation, the country\u2019s performance in pollution control\nis not appreciable. Still many locations in the country are under pollution threat.\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n147\n\nOnly Kerala formulated a separate policy to deal with water pollution. The Water\nPolicy of most of the states also does not give adequate emphasis on the prevention\nand control of water pollution. The recent study by CAG (2011) concludes that\nwater pollution has not been adequately addressed in any policy in India, both at the\ncentral and the State levels. Besides, in the absence of a specific \u2018water pollution\npolicy\u2019 which would also incorporate the prevention of pollution, the treatment of\npolluted water and ecological restoration of polluted water bodies, the government\u2019s\nefforts in these areas would not get the required emphasis and thrust. Further, CAG\n(2011) study observed a serious failure in planning, implementation and monitoring\nvarious programs for the control of the pollution of rivers, lakes and groundwater,\nwhich are summarized below.\nFor planning the MoEF and the states: (a) Did not undertake a complete inventory of rivers/lakes and species associated with them. (b) Did not carry out an identification of the existing pollution levels in terms of biological indicators. (c) Had\nnot identified and quantified contaminants, including human activities. (d) Did not\nassess the risks of polluted water to health and environment. (e) Did not adopt the\nbasin level approach for the control of pollution. (f) Did not develop water quality\ngoals, and failed to enforce them (CAG 2011).\nWith regard to implementation: (a) Current programmes were insufficient. (b)\nInstitutional set-up to manage various programmes was inadequate. (c) Inclusion of\nrivers and lakes in NRCP and NLCP respectively, was flawed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71fee620-0c1f-4e18-a8e1-be5347129f89": {"__data__": {"id_": "71fee620-0c1f-4e18-a8e1-be5347129f89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f013180-d408-46a1-9360-0186454f8def", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaa2a967e89e0fec53b79e49f140165b1714c7a2aec28dd3008bfcac71d0c41d"}, "3": {"node_id": "374f249a-42ea-4517-839b-ddb0a746c293", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f185baf9c510f35fb697528c26ae2dadbe22aba2bef5286a7ff3c126f9a45c1"}}, "hash": "f51ed2e30fc002951d0ff55f7412f1cbbcae533766e17d8092c4279ba15bb0aa", "text": "(d) 82 % of the projects undertaken under NRCP were completed after the scheduled date.\nIn monitoring: (a) Inspection and monitoring of projects being implemented\nunder NRCP and NLCP was inadequate at all three levels, i.e., local, state and central.

(c) No\nreal-time monitoring of water quality was taking place and the data on water quality\nhad not been disseminated adequately.\nThus, one can conclude that the programmes to control the pollution of rivers,\nlakes and groundwater in India have not had the desired results.\n\n8.6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn developing countries, environmental management strategies are not satisfactory.\nMany of the responsible bodies for water-related services, have centralized structures, which inadequately deal with issues of consultation and interaction with other\nstakeholders, especially users have proven to have a weak effect regarding water\npollution control (European Commission 2000). Besides, water pollution has not\nbeen a major topic of political debate yet, and therefore, political instruments have\nbeen scarcely implemented. But responses such as Environmental Quality Objectives\n(EQOs) and uniform standards have so far been on the political agenda in the western developed world (Kraemer et al. 2001). However, rigorous but phased legislation with realistic timetables, and enforcement of technical standards can act as key\n\n \n148\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\ncatalysts of change in water pollution abatement (Stockholm Water Front 2000). In\ndeveloping countries like India, emission-based standards have not been very effective so far, since they are rarely monitored and only occasionally enforced. It is also\nincorrect to adopt western water quality objectives that are inappropriate to the level\nof development and economic state of the adopting country.\nPast experiences has revealed that though India attempted to solve the water pollution issues through legislative and policy measures with huge budgets over a\nperiod of time, significant progress has not been achieved. The overall status of the\nquality of water in rivers, lakes and the ground is not satisfactory. The risks of polluted water to the health of humans, and living organisms, and the environment are\ncritical issues.\nA country like India, that possesses 17 % of the world\u2019s population with 4 % of\nwater resources, extracts its water significantly for various developmental purposes.\nHuge quantities of water have been transferred from rivers and the lakes for irrigational, domestic and industrial purposes. Hence, the water flow or storage capacity\nof water bodies has declined substantially, and this adversely affects its waste\nassimilation/sink functions. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the problem\nof future management of water quality, though complex, is solvable. Surely, it is not\nrealistic to aim for zero water pollution, but a level of socially acceptable pollution,\nrespecting the integrity of ecosystems and service provision can be reached. Hence\na rethinking towards a more innovative and suitable approach is needed with an\nemphasis on the following strategies.\nPolicy Advocacy, Governance and Enforcement Precautionary and preventive\napproaches instead of end-of-pipe solutions need to be promoted at all decision and\npolicy levels. Stricter action should be taken to combat corruption in the water sector. Corruption leads to ineffective implementation of water protection policies, and\nundermines the efficiency of pollution prevention policies (Kraemer et al. 2001). At\nthe national and regional level, water pollution prevention policies should be integrated into non-water policies that have implications on water quality such as, agriculture and land use management, trade, industry, energy, and urban development.\nIt is increasingly recognized that integrated water protection planning is suitable for\nthe reduction of many forms of water pollution. Considering the negative externality issues; water pollution should be made a punishable offence. The effectiveness\nand power of the \u201cpolluter pay principle\u201d should be considered. The enforcement\nagencies should function impartially and strictly.\nStakeholders Initiatives and Capacity Building In pollution management, the participation of the multi-stakeholders is important. Various policies, plans and strategies to protect water resources should be participatory, allowing for consultation\nbetween government, industry and the public. For effective decision making, it is\nnecessary to improve the flow of information towards all stakeholders. Often, the\nlack of public awareness on the importance of water pollution prevention and low\nparticipation in improvement efforts, contributes to a deterioration of the pollution\nproblem (World Bank 1998).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "374f249a-42ea-4517-839b-ddb0a746c293": {"__data__": {"id_": "374f249a-42ea-4517-839b-ddb0a746c293", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "71fee620-0c1f-4e18-a8e1-be5347129f89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f51ed2e30fc002951d0ff55f7412f1cbbcae533766e17d8092c4279ba15bb0aa"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4a84b9a-18ce-4e40-8711-d44abc220e27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9edb63d0d0ae43c64bf5d1b63a99fb3a9941c964244c6265c0556253671f90ef"}}, "hash": "7f185baf9c510f35fb697528c26ae2dadbe22aba2bef5286a7ff3c126f9a45c1", "text": "According to the Commission on Sustainable\nDevelopment (2000), there has been an increasing awareness of the need to\n\n \n8\n\nWater Pollution: Extent, Impact, and Abatement\n\n149\n\nstrengthen technical and managerial capacity at all levels of the government and\nlocal community. At the local level, capacity building enables the community to\nmake decisions and disseminate them to the appropriate authorities, thus influencing political processes.\nEconomic Instruments Recently, the emphasis on policy regarding water pollution\nhas shifted towards environmental management, using incentives, cost-effective\nstrategies and improved performance to achieve sustainability (World Bank 1998).\nThe market-based strategies (charges, environmental taxes, pollution levies and\ntradable permit systems) should be enhanced to the utmost possible extent. Higher\ncharges, fines and penalties act as disincentives to pollution. Besides, it brings revenue to the government that can be used to fight against or abate water pollution.\nFurther, incentive mechanisms, such as subsidies, soft loans, tax relaxation etc.,\nshould be included in installing pollution management devices.\nTechnology Development/Transfer and Input Substitute In industrial pollution\nmanagement, technological attempts should be made through Cleaner Production\nTechnology (CPT) rather than end of the pipe devices like Effluent Treatment\nPlants. User friendly and affordable CPT should be developed with the support of\nindustrial development agencies.

In this regard, the\nattempt of the \u201cRiver Basin Board\u201d at Palar in Tamil Nadu, was appreciable. Right\nnow, there are multiple agencies involved in river and lake conservation, right from\nplanning to implementation and monitoring, without proper coordination. Hence\nthe consolidation of all activities under an umbrella agency is required for better\ncoordination and accountability.\nIntegrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Generally, fresh water sources\n(river, lake and aquifer) are Common Pool Resources in nature, and are experiencing the \u2018free rider\u2019 problem. Unfortunately, the collective efforts on water bodies\u2019\nmanagement are not effective, particularly in urban areas, and are experiencing the\nphenomenon of the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019. Water quality and quantity are interlinked. The polluted water is an \u2018externality\u2019 issue, and its environmental and social\nimpacts are far-reaching. In this context, pollution management should be part of\nIWRM, and should safeguard the interests of different water users. At present,\nwaste water treatment plants generate huge quantities of sludge, which becomes a\nthreat to the environment and fresh water sources. Therefore, the safe disposal of\nsludge is a pre-requisite for maintaining the water quality. Since fresh water is\nincreasingly getting scarce the application/use of treated waste water for appropriate use is an effective waste management strategy. For example, the waste water\n\n \n150\n\nP. Nelliyat\n\ngenerated in urban areas can be used for peri-urban agriculture and industry, after\nthe required treatment.\nIn brief, in a rapidly developing countries like India, which possess more population and limited water resources, allocation and management of water for various\ndevelopmental activities and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem are huge\nchallenges. In these circumstances, threat of pollution to the fresh water sources\naggravate the problem and become an add-on challenge. Sometimes polluted river\nis more problematic than a river without water. When the public awareness on pollution and its impacts are limited, the cost of pollution on human health and ecosystem is huge. The victims of pollution are generally, the poor or socially vulnerable\ncommunities who are having limited coping strategy against pollution. Considering\nthe above issues, the effective pollution management strategies need to be implemented with multi-stakeholders initiatives.\n\nReferences\nAhmed, S. (1990).

Basic regulatory instruments that are being or could be adopted in water management are broadly grouped under: (i) direct and indirect regulation, (ii) economic\nregulation, and (iii) social regulation.\nThe review of the role of regulatory instruments in managing water demand\nacross the countries suggests that the commonly used instruments like pricing, supply regulation, direct and indirect policy regulation, etc., have not been effective.\nThis is more so in India due to complex socioeconomic and resource systems and\npolicy environment. Often policies are neither comprehensive nor they work in tandem. It is argued that unless policy, economic and institutional regulations complement each other, the scope for achieving sustainable and efficient water management\nis a far cry.\nNone of the regulatory instruments have equity in-built in to them.

Social regulation initiatives may remain as models rather than being\nadapted at a wider scale in the absence of complementary policy/legislative/legal\nsupport.

The need for action in this direction is growing, as countries and\ncommunities across the globe are increasingly experiencing water stress in various\ncontexts. Water stress often leads to civil strife and conflict. The conflicts could be\ntraced from micro level to global level (Reddy et al. 2005). These conflicts are\nexpected to be more frequent in future due to the increasing pressure on the resource\nconsequent to anthropogenic as well as climate change factors. Increasing intersectoral competition between agriculture and other users (i.e., drinking water, agriculture, industry) and intra-sectoral competition, especially in the case of irrigation,\nis adding to the complexity of managing both surface and groundwater resources.\nThese conflicts represent culmination of gross neglect and miss-management of\nwater resources over the years. For, the problem is not due to absolute shortage of\nwater, but due to the absence of proper mechanisms for conservation, distribution\nand efficient use.\nIn spite of rapidly increasing value for water resources, water policies continue\nto be supply sided. Water demand management is often ignored in the major policy\nformulations. In most cases the projections of water demand are in terms of crop/\nhuman/livestock water requirements that are fixed normatively in a given environmental, socioeconomic and technological conditions. Therefore, the impact of\ndemand management approaches on the use of water is not properly evaluated. Such\nan approach provides a basis for evaluating whether specific investments in water\nmanagement are justified (Thompson and Young 1973). The literature on water\ndemand management indicates that water demand could be managed using regulatory instruments at various levels. However, different regulatory instruments operate and their effectiveness varies across locations depending on the economic and\nsocio-cultural conditions. These instruments are often enmeshed or integrated in to\ninstitutional arrangements and policy initiatives. Besides, the political economy factors play an equally important role in adopting regulatory instruments.\nThis paper is an attempt to review the role of various regulatory instruments in\nmanaging water demand. Specific objectives include:\n(i) To list out types of regulatory instruments\n(ii) Assess the role of these instruments in managing water demand and attaining\nequity in access\n(iii) Assess existing case studies and draw lessons for policy\nIrrigation water management assumes paramount importance in the situation\nmarked by water stress and in the agrarian economies like India.

Drinking water sector, on the other\nhand, is the socially most sensitive area and needs utmost attention. Within these\ntwo sectors groundwater management is the most important policy challenge given\nthe fact that groundwater is the single largest as well as ill managed source in terms\nof equity and sustainability. This review covers the experience of regulatory instruments in managing water in the context of irrigation and drinking water with a focus\non groundwater.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7f5ebfd-ef75-495b-9f99-5722ff1f8b77": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7f5ebfd-ef75-495b-9f99-5722ff1f8b77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3dd3df4a-0756-4061-99f9-be8a3555c183", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4cb0756b1b85c8b2a1c3600530e2224557d21051cb0360ddcca503d7aa61cd6"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec0ba8eb-6a64-4d96-b2cd-8037c459b52d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "87fc4490767a5b0b1a5128c091868f4aad2f26302e3f335a158db323c2e221e5"}}, "hash": "e4c718ba3dee4f430ea16282f62ea1cf03e4f9926c1cd7e06bc44da307e333f4", "text": "9.2\n\nRegulatory Instruments: Types and Nature\n\nLack of clarity in property rights on water requires implementation of sanctioning\nand enforcement of water allocation mechanisms at the policy level. Rigid and static\ngovernance structures fail the policy makers to understand the changing water scenario. Lack of information at appropriate scale is a bottleneck at the community\nlevel for adopting informed water management practices (Reddy 2012). The absence\nof appropriate information coupled with high economic value is making access to\nwater a highly sensitive issue. Therefore, it is necessary to manage water in a sustainable and equitable manner. In the light of supply constraints or limited options,\ndemand management or regulation assumes importance at different levels (national,\nstate and community levels). Based on a review of existing literature the basic regulatory instruments that are being or could be adopted in water management are\nbroadly grouped under: (i) direct and indirect regulation, (ii) economic regulation,\nand (iii) social regulation. These three groups in a way are overlapping and all of\nthem even come under policy regulation. For, pricing is done at the policy level and\nmost of the institutions are also initiated through policy, except some local or informal institutions. However, this grouping is for convenience and clarity. In what\nfollows we briefly discuss these instruments.\n\n9.2.1\n\nDirect and Indirect Regulation\n\nWater management in India falls within the jurisdiction of the state government that\nis responsible for the financing, cost recovery and management of all water resources\n(Saleth 2005). However, Central Government has the concurrent power to make\nlaws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India. Policies or\npolicy guidelines are often made at the central level and enforced or implemented at\nthe state level. States also make policies on their own and implement. Direct and\nindirect regulation is the most commonly used instrument for regulating water\ndemand, especially groundwater use. Direct regulations include restrictions on timing of water supply, quantum of water supply, digging new wells, well depths, etc.,\nwhich are generally enforced by the administrative process (Shah 2009). Indirect\n\n \n156\n\nV.R. Reddy\n\nregulations include restricted supply of electricity for pumping, restrictions on\nfinancing, cropping restrictions, price and procurement policies, technology policy,\netc. These regulations consist of complex and multilayer framework of a range of\nconstitutional and statutory provisions at the central and state levels.\nIn India water rights are based on riparian law that gives right to water based on\nproximity. Communities close to the water sources (rivers) have the first right. In the\ncase of groundwater the Indian Easements Act of 1882, which mentions about the\nprivate property rights over groundwater use, forms the basis for groundwater regulation in India (Saleth 2005). Adopted from the English Common Law, which gives\nevery owner of land \u201cthe right \u2026 to collect and dispose within his own limits of all\nwater under the land, which does not pass in a defined channel\u201d (World Bank 2010).\nThus, groundwater is treated as an appendage to land because it is an easement connected to land and person who owns the land owns groundwater beneath the land.\nThey have also the right to transfer the rights over groundwater with transferring the\nownership of land. Given the high inequalities in the land ownership and skewed in\nfavour of large farmers (i.e., 15 % of the households own 80 % of the land), access\nto groundwater is not only iniquitous but also used inefficiently resulting in unsustainable exploitation of the resource.\n\n9.2.1.1\n\nSurface Water\n\nIn the case of surface irrigation regulations are introduced through institutional\narrangements like water user organisations (WUAs). These organisations enforce\nregulations with policy support. The regulatory instruments in the case of surface\nwater systems include: crop restricts, water charges, timing the release of water, etc.\nIn most of the countries, majority transfer units are subsections of main irrigation\nsystems that are managed by farmer organizations while the main system continues\nto be managed by a government authority. Most of these transfer units in developed\ncountries tend to be water users\u2019 associations that take over O & M responsibility\ndirectly. However, in some of the countries such as in some parts of India, USA,\nMexico, Japan, and Taiwan, the farmer-elected bodies handle large-scale posttransfer governance. These countries have stronger legal systems and local institutions that are more capable of handling management at large scales of complexity.\nBut most parts of Asia and Africa often lack legal powers of rights and ability to\nenforce rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec0ba8eb-6a64-4d96-b2cd-8037c459b52d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec0ba8eb-6a64-4d96-b2cd-8037c459b52d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7f5ebfd-ef75-495b-9f99-5722ff1f8b77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4c718ba3dee4f430ea16282f62ea1cf03e4f9926c1cd7e06bc44da307e333f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "6db49ceb-aa13-4fea-a80e-bbc81b781886", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "718ada9e9fb2cc7324635e8eb9e8f6618079be446f1bab73727ed04af391c1b8"}}, "hash": "87fc4490767a5b0b1a5128c091868f4aad2f26302e3f335a158db323c2e221e5", "text": "Most of the cases involve only partial transfer of control over irrigation O & M, especially for larger systems. The evidence indicates that regulations\nare used to achieve: (i) efficient water delivery services to suit the local needs, (ii)\nincrease in the area irrigated and productivity, (iii) reduced financial burden on the\nState, and (iv) reduction in the adverse environmental effects.\nRecognizing the importance of users in management to solve the main problems\nfaced by the government in managing the irrigation systems, some States in India\nadopted participatory management policies though the policies differed from State\nto State (Reddy et al. 2005). For instance, in Bihar, the two tier WUAs exists at village and distributary channel. Entire O & M responsibilities are vested with the\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n157\n\ndistributary channels and below to these WUAs. The associations are authorized to\ncollect irrigation fees and in return they can keep 70 % of the collected amount. In\nHaryana, legal and government irrigation arrangements are based on precedents set\nby the Moghul emperors and by the British government and the basic irrigation\nmanagement system is warabandi or rotational irrigation. The State is considering a\npolicy to create WUAs at outlet level and assign full O & M responsibilities below\nthe outlet, including maintenance of lined water courses. It is also contemplated that\nthe WUAs collect irrigation fees in return for keeping a small commission. However,\nthe devolution of these powers are yet to be transferred.\nGujarat has a reputation for innovation in irrigation management based on a\nnumber of well-publicized experiments since 1978. However, only in 1995 the State\ndeclared a policy of management transfer. It stipulates creation of WUAs for a block\nof 500-ha and transfer full O & M responsibilities for minor and smaller channels\nwithin the blocks to the WUAs. WUAs have to pay the price for water on the basis\nof the volume of water actually taken. The State is also planning to invite NGOs to\ncarry out the work of creation of WUAs in cooperation with the personnel of Water\nResource Department. The policy made provision for incentives, including channel\nrepairs, rebates for prompt payment of irrigation fees, and maintenance grants\nGujarat Water Users Participation Management Act, 2007 was recent when compared to Andhra Pradesh. The experience shows that these formal PIM initiatives\nsuffer from legal and legislative support, financial sustainability; water scarcity, etc\n(GoI n.d.). Even the earlier experience in Gujarat indicated that generating funds for\ncovering 100 % 100 O & M continues to be a major challenge (Parthasarathy 2000).\nMaharashtra has the long history of development and management of private\nirrigation schemes. The irrigation department manages the State\u2019s canal systems and\nthe basic irrigation management approach is called shejpali although alternatives\nexist. It adopted a policy to create WUAs at minor canal level (with average command of 500 ha); transfer O & M responsibilities for the minor and smaller channels\nto the WUAs; allocate water to the WUAs through 5-year agreements and charge\nWUAs for water on the basis of the volume actually taken (Volumetric pricing). This\nnew system will replace shejpali. Like Gujarat, Maharashtra also envisaged incentives for farmers. In Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Orissa the present transfer of irrigation\nmanagement to WUAs are creating a three-tier system of management organization\nincluding WUAs at the outlet and 500 ha command levels and a joint management\ncommittee (including representatives of the WUAs and of key government agencies) at project level, and transferring O & M responsibilities fully or partially to\nthese bodies. It is observed that the Maharashtra experience is very similar to Gujarat\nas far as O&M recovery is concerned and devolution of powers (GoI n.d.).\nIn Andhra Pradesh, Irrigation and Command Area Development (CAD) Act that\nwas enacted in the year 1984 imposed the creation of command area development\nauthorities and \u2018Pipe Committees\u2019. These \u2018Pipe Committees\u2019 proved to be quite\nineffective as the delivery of water at the outlet was quite unrealistic leaving no\nscope to the pipe committees to effect any improvement in the distribution of water.\nThe Pipe Committees had no role in the maintenance and their responsibilities were\nnot defined and hence were non-functional (Joshi 1997).

Reddy\n\nact in the year 1997 called \u201cThe Andhra Pradesh Farmers\u2019 Management of\nIrrigation\u201d created a three-tier WUAs system at hydraulic level, Distributary\nCommittee and Project Committee. More than 10,000 WUAs have been created\nwith a clearly specified responsibilities and powers. A provision was also made to\nprovide financial assistance for those WUAs that enhance water fee collections in\ntheir commands (Brewer et al. 1999). Though Andhra Pradesh experiment has been\nlauded as pioneering in participatory irrigation, the reform process has not been\ntaken to its logical conclusion. Devolution of powers to the WUAs is very partial\nand financial sustainability and covering O& M costs remain major issues (Reddy\nand Reddy 2005; GoI 2007a).\n\n9.2.1.2\n\nGroundwater\n\nDirect and indirect regulation is more prominent in the case of groundwater as it\ndoes not involve communities or collectives. This include regulations on number\nand depth of the wells, distance between the wells, regulating supply of electricity,\npricing of electricity or diesel, etc. India introduced a Model Groundwater Bill during 1972 constituting a groundwater management agency at the state level, which is\nresponsible for registrations and control of larger groundwater users. Some of the\nmajor elements of this bill include power to notify areas for control and regulation\nof groundwater development, grant of permission to extract and use water in the\nnotified areas, registration of existing users in the notified areas, prohibition of carrying on sinking wells, etc. The Model Groundwater (Control and Regulation) Bill\nof 1992 proposes a kind of groundwater permits systems. However, it did not set\nany withdrawal limits (GoI 1992) and confined only in the states of Tamil Nadu,\nMaharashtra, and Karnataka. National Water Policy of 2002 also makes certain provisions on control of groundwater extraction.\nDuring the late 1990s states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, and Maharashtra\nhave enacted groundwater legislations. These legislations imposed restrictions on\ngroundwater exploitation by making registration of wells as well as rigging technologies mandatory. The implementation and enforcement of these legislations are\nyet to bear fruits due to various reasons. For, these legislations have failed to take\nspecial distribution of the resource in to account by putting all the regions irrespective of their level of groundwater development. Similarly socioeconomic equity is\nnot taken in to account while enforcing the regulations i.e., treating those having\nand not having wells equally. Due to the negligence and conflict of interests of all\nsections of the society enforcement has received scant attention (Sharma 1995).\nSimilarly, monitoring mechanism to ensure a particular regulation is enforced is a\ncostly and difficult task in vast and remote regions (Kumar 2007). Given the size,\nspread and variety of groundwater extraction across the country it would be a big\nchallenge to bring groundwater under a formal system of control or sanctions. The\nsheer size and anarchy prevailing in this regard is main bottleneck for enforcing\nsanctions (Shah 2009).\nLimiting power supply and formal credit are the indirect ways of regulating\ngroundwater use. A number of states in India follow power supply regulations for\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n159\n\none reason or another. The main reason, often made explicit, for restricted power\nsupply is supply constraint as well as reducing the burden on exchequer due to subsidised or free power supplied to farm sector. The externality of restricted power\nsupply is regulation of groundwater use. In fact, farmers express that \u2018but for the\nlimited power supply their bore wells would have gone dry\u2019, especially during\ndrought years. The power supply restricts are usually associated with subsidies or\nfree power. Gujarat Electricity Board does not provide new electricity connection\nfor extraction of groundwater in over-exploited, critical and saline areas without\nconsent of the CGWA. It has also launched Jyoti Gram Service (JGS) which put\nseparate feeder provisions for agriculture and domestic services (Lakhina 2007).\nThere is only 8 h/day power supply to agricultural purposes. As a result farmers are\nalerted every time and optimized utilization of water pumped out which reduced\nover-exploitation and ensure investment in demand side water management measure. Andhra Pradesh has been using 7\u20139 h a day power supply along with free\npower policy over the last 7 years.\nNational Bank for Rural Development (NABARD) has adopted a policy not to\nprovide refinance wells in critical and over exploited areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e9f2008-b6a4-48f4-9758-94750b4b883e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e9f2008-b6a4-48f4-9758-94750b4b883e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "6db49ceb-aa13-4fea-a80e-bbc81b781886", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "718ada9e9fb2cc7324635e8eb9e8f6618079be446f1bab73727ed04af391c1b8"}, "3": {"node_id": "59e47ad2-ba3d-437f-b5ac-e54be1b99929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e36a73a8b868d63a7cedb20eca5b221cf3846d7de917b9d41b75fa3fb05c91a"}}, "hash": "b1090f658bce759f9d11ed13288359672a8b1f51a92b700080ba0db6d6683e30", "text": "NABARD has prescribed spacing norms for different types of areas whereby minimum distance\nbetween two groundwater obstruction structures can be indicated (IRM&ED 2008).\nAccording NABARD regulation, farmers do not get credit for a new bore well if it\nis located within 200 m radius of an existing well. These restrictions are also\nimposed by other nationalized banks. However, implementation or enforcement of\nsuch regulations have their own limitations as formal credit accounts for minor\nshare in the investment in groundwater development.\nThe Punjab Government has recently introduced the Punjab Preservation of SubSoil Water Ordinance 2008, which prohibits the planting of paddy by the farmers in\nthe state before June 10th to conserve groundwater. The ordinance provides for the\ngovernment agencies to plough the area with the standing crop of such farmers who\ntransplant paddy before the notified date. The effectiveness of this order in dissuading farmers to sow early paddy and thereby conserve groundwater is, however, yet\nto be seen.\n\n9.2.1.3\n\nTechnology\n\nTechnologies are often given little importance in the demand side management of\nwater. Managing water demand through promotion/discouraging technology is a\nless explored option. This is mainly because of the reason that the area covered\nunder water saving technologies is negligible. Promotion of micro irrigation is the\nmost widely used across the countries. Micro irrigation such as sprinkler and drip\nirrigation are being promoted through subsidy in order to increase water use efficiencies. In Israel policies are designed to use only these technologies for irrigation.\nOf late more and more area in India is being brought under these technologies in\norder to tackle the scarcity conditions. These technologies are spreading to more\nnumber of crops instead of limiting to horticultural crops earlier. In Gujarat farmers\nuse micro irrigation systems on various crops like wheat, bajra, maize, groundnut,\n\n \n160\n\nV.R. Reddy\n\ncotton, castor and vegetables apart from number of horticultural crops while drip\nsystems are used even on water intensive crops like sugarcane in Maharashtra\n(Narayanamoorthy 2003). Though these technologies are subsidised, access to subsidies is limited to few farmers making it expensive for small and marginal farmers.\nCommunity based ownership or funding of these technologies yet to take shape.\nMoreover, use of these systems are limited to groundwater as there is no incentive\nto use them in canal irrigated regions.\nSimilarly, water efficient crops or cultivation methods are being promoted in\norder to overcome water shortages or water stress. One such example is the System\nof Rice Intensification (SRI), which requires less water when compared to the traditional flood irrigation with same productivity per unit of land is notorious for its\nhigh dis-adaptation rates at the farmers level in the absence pricing regulations on\nwater use. There is a need for exploring innovative regulatory mechanisms in order\nto promote water use efficiency.\nIn the case of domestic water supplies also there are technologies that can reduce\nwater use to the extent of 50 % (Postel 1985). These include faucets, shower heads,\ntoilet flushes, etc. Countries like Israel, Italy, USA (California, Michigan and\nNew York states) have passed laws requiring installation of various water efficient\nappliances in new homes, apartments and officer (Postel 1984). Installation of these\ntechnologies in the new constructions is made mandatory for giving permission.\nWhile imposing such regulations at the user level is not only difficult but also\ninvolves high transaction costs, imposing such regulations at the industry level\ncould be much easier. For instance banning the production of high water intensive\nfaucets, shower heads, flushes, etc., could be achieved with policy regulation (Reddy\n1996). Incentives like tax holidays or tax exemptions could be provided to those\nindustries or products for improved water use efficiency. Combining such instruments with price instruments could result in faster adoption, as it happened in the\ncase of fuel efficient four stroke engines of two wheelers in India. Use of such regulatory instruments in the water sector needs to be explored. In our view, these are\nsome of the low hanging fruits, which need to be picked up.\n\n9.2.2\n\nEconomic Regulation\n\nPricing of water or a complementary input like electricity or diesel, water markets\nand tradable water rights are some of the important economic instruments that are\nused. While direct pricing of water is used in the case of surface water, other instruments are more common in the case of groundwater management. Economic instruments in India include charges and taxes levied on irrigation water or volume of\nwater withdrawn such as the 1994 Water Law in China (Wang et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59e47ad2-ba3d-437f-b5ac-e54be1b99929": {"__data__": {"id_": "59e47ad2-ba3d-437f-b5ac-e54be1b99929", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e9f2008-b6a4-48f4-9758-94750b4b883e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1090f658bce759f9d11ed13288359672a8b1f51a92b700080ba0db6d6683e30"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfa0ea6d-f299-4fe3-a748-288f9ad6cf6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a4f017b3e805ab12359f441b62422547c614555f6d3cb34e699cfe7bc6fe6f2"}}, "hash": "8e36a73a8b868d63a7cedb20eca5b221cf3846d7de917b9d41b75fa3fb05c91a", "text": "2007), Law of\nthe Nation\u2019s Water in Mexico (Shah et al. 2004; Scott and Shah 2004; Sandoval\n2004), and Israel (Feitelson 2006). An example of taxes as an economic instrument\nis found in the Chennai city. Municipal water utility is paying farmers to sell bore\nwell supplies to meet the drinking water demand in the urban areas which created\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n161\n\nincentives for the farmers for moving water to a higher-value use and reduced mismanagement in groundwater allocation. However, it is very difficult to collect and\nenforce such a fee in case of large resource users or poor governance environment\n(Shah 2009). Pricing as a demand management variable is widely studied in the case\nof canal water. For groundwater is rarely priced.\n\n9.2.2.1\n\nSurface Water\n\nVolumetric pricing is expected to be effective in conserving water and improving\nwater use efficiency. However, volumetric pricing is followed in very few cases. A\nbroader issue: is volumetric pricing technically feasible in Indian irrigation systems,\nas metering of irrigation water has become politically sensitive issue in number of\nstates. Besides, this is mainly due to high costs associated with fixing water meters\nand monitoring them. Even in the few cases where volumetric pricing is adopted,\nwater is often under priced with little impact on water demand. In other words, as\nlong as volumetric pricing is not equated with marginal cost pricing, pricing is not\ngoing to be an effective tool of demand management. This is mainly due to the reason that marginal cost based pricing is often found to be politically unacceptable\nand also may impose undue burden on the marginal sections of the farming community. In the absence of volumetric pricing water pricing on the basis of acreage is\nfound to be the easiest way of implementation administratively.\n\n9.2.2.2\n\nGroundwater\n\nElectricity pricing is more commonly followed instrument in India. Electricity has\npotential to regulate the use of groundwater. For instance, it is argued in the context\nof Western India that electricity pricing enhances groundwater use efficiency\n(Kumar 2005). The study estimates the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic and shows that pricing is socio-economically\nviable. But the main difficulties lying with the price mechanism is that of implementation. There is lack of required administrative resources for metering and monitoring groundwater use and collecting user fees. During the 1970s, Government of\nIndia had faced difficulty of metering about two million wells and thus implemented\nflat tariff on electricity used by agriculture. At present the number of wells is over\n20 million aggravating administrative difficulties and transaction costs. Besides,\npricing is a politically sensitive issue, especially when populism has become the\nnorm (Kemper 2007).\nDevelopment of private groundwater market has a long history in rural India\n(Pant 2005; Saleth 1994). Even though selling of water was traced out during 1920s,\nit was in the 1960\u2019 when systematic information started flowing (Saleth 2005).\nGroundwater markets are widespread in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,\nUttar Pradesh and West Bengal (IRM&ED 2008). However, there is no clear cut\nstatistics about the total area under private groundwater market. Based on his stud-\n\n \n162\n\nV.R. Reddy\n\nies from Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, Shah (1993) projected that the area irrigated\nunder groundwater markets was about 50 % of the total gross irrigated area under\nprivate lift irrigation. Whereas Shankar (1992) mentions that the actual area varies\nbetween 80 % in Gujarat to 60 % in Uttar Pradesh. A Tamil Nadu study shows that\nit is not more than 30 % (Janakarajan 1993). Market forms basically with mutual\nunderstanding between two adjacent farmers on sharing of water (Mukherji 2007).\nIt serves two purposes: promoting efficient use and providing water to poor farmers\nwho are either unable to afford wells or find it uneconomical to do so (Shah 1989,\n1993; IRM&ED 2008). Markets also increase cropping intensity and demand for\nagricultural labour, which ultimately benefits the landless and wage labour (Fujita\nand Hussain 1995). But, markets ensure neither equity, especially in scarcity conditions, nor source sustainability (Reddy 2010).\n\n9.2.3\n\nSocial Regulation\n\nCommunity management of groundwater is very limited in its spread despite the\nfact the community management of irrigation (tank or canal) is very old.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa0ea6d-f299-4fe3-a748-288f9ad6cf6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa0ea6d-f299-4fe3-a748-288f9ad6cf6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "59e47ad2-ba3d-437f-b5ac-e54be1b99929", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e36a73a8b868d63a7cedb20eca5b221cf3846d7de917b9d41b75fa3fb05c91a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3cc37e8-978f-4e38-9913-25e124640230", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f122b39c58014f5e3acbeb8a0798f8f1a8f857c1362beb145346ee4528a063f"}}, "hash": "5a4f017b3e805ab12359f441b62422547c614555f6d3cb34e699cfe7bc6fe6f2", "text": "This is\nmainly due to the private property or open access nature of groundwater resource.\nParticipatory approach to groundwater management in India is based on the western\nUnited States experience of the management of aquifer by the communities. This\nmodel has also been tried in Spain and Mexico where users are registered and organized into associations with a mandate to manage sustainably (Villarroya and\nAldwell 1998; Sandoval 2004). Thus \u2018community management\u2019 implies creation of\nself-governing water user organisations who take the responsibility of sustainable\nmanagement of aquifers through collective action (Shah 2009). The main objectives\nof management process are to focus on demand side management through participatory data collection, analysis and dissemination (GoAP 2007). It can also involve\nany mix of instruments including regulation, property rights and pricing (World\nBank 2010).\nPani Panchayat or water council in Maharashtra is one of the first institutions to\npromote social regulation initiatives in order to improve access to water, water use\nefficiency and equity. Social regulations such as restricts on digging of bore wells,\nspecified cropping pattern, water distribution, equal access to water to all households, including landless. This was adopted in a number of villages with mixed\nresults (Deshpande and Reddy 1990). A different type of peoples\u2019 participation was\nfound in Rajasthan. Villagers decided to stop sinking of bore wells to preserve and\njudiciously use the water resources at their disposal. As a result no bore well is\nfound within the 4 km radius of the village (IRM&ED 2008). In Kerala two community managed groundwater projects were implemented for proper utilization of\nwater for irrigation. As per the instructions two persons can irrigate their land at a\ntime. Farmers bear electrical and O&M charges and succeed to achieve financial\nand source sustainability.\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n163\n\nCheck dam Movement was started in Gujarat where farmers formed village level\nlocal institutions (Gandhi and Sharma 2009). Under this system villagers undertake\nplanning, finance and construction of a system of check dams in and around the village to collect and store rainwater to recharge the groundwater aquifers and thereby\nrecharge the dug wells. Expected benefits are increased water table and improved\nagricultural income. However, there was no collective action on reducing overextraction. Communities were self interested and every farmer in the community\nwas free to extract whatever they want rather than focusing on collective targets for\ncrop diversification or water use reduction.\nOf late quite a few initiatives of social regulation are being tried in a number of\nstates. Some of them are knowledge based and some combine awareness building\nwith social regulation (GoI 2011).

It also improves the self-regulatory capacity,\ncounteracts corruption and facilitates the coordination of decisions relating to\ngroundwater, land use and waste management. According to Burke et al. (1999),\nsocio-economic, political and institutional factors are main determinates, which\nincentivise these stakeholders in sustainable groundwater management.\n\n \n164\n\n9.3\n\nV.R. Reddy\n\nEffectiveness of Regulatory Instruments:\nReview of Experience\n\nAs far as the impact of direct and indirect regulation on water use and efficiency\nare concerned, evidence across the globe indicates that quotas are more effective in\nregulating demand. Supply regulation though found to be inefficient in the long\nrun, it happens to be the most preferred option among the administrators. Quotas or\nsupply regulations arise due to resource shortages. Less water is distributed equally\namong all the farmers in the years of water scarcity. During the drought years\nbetween 2001 and 2004 the Krishna delta farmers in Andhra Pradesh were provided\nwith 40 % less supply of water when compared to normal years. Farmers not only\nmanaged with low supplies of water but also reported 20 % higher yields. This\nreveals the extent of water wastage and inefficiencies during normal years. Hence,\nquotas lead by shortages are more preferred to volumetric or marginal cost based\npricing.\nFor instance, in Andhra Pradesh though some benefits from WUA regulations in\nterms of increased area under irrigation in canal systems and improved quality of\nirrigation is evident, the sustainability of these benefits is rather uncertain in the\nabsence of efficient institutional structures. Equity in the management and distribution of water is not addressed. No proper incentive (positive and negative) structures\nwere designed and placed to support rule compliance (Reddy and Reddy 2005). In\nRajasthan, though more than 800 WUAs were constituted and elections were conducted almost 5 years back, the progress is very tardy. So far no devolution of powers has taken place, though the irrigation department appears to be keen in devolving\nthe powers (Reddy 2010). In Orissa the Government claims that the PIM programme\nallows farmers to take decisions regarding distribution and management of water\nresources. In reality the programme has created a divide between the large and\nsmall& landless. Landless are not even members of the pani panchayat. The rotation\nof canal water use resulted in poor farmers having rabi crop only once in 2 years and\nincreasing inequity. Consequently, people rebelled against the programme and the\nmodel has collapsed, but not before causing much misery (Das 2006). On the whole,\nbenefits from regulations through institutional arrangements (WUAs) are mostly\nlimited to shifting the O&M responsibilities to the farming communities. Effectively,\nthe impacts in terms of water use efficiencies and financial sustainability are limited. And there is no evidence of improved equity.\nIn the case of groundwater, a model bill to regulate and control development of\ngroundwater has been circulated by the Ministry of Water Resources to all the\nStates/Union Territories (UTs). So far 11 States/UTs Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Tamil\nNadu, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Union Territories of\nChandigarh, Lakshadweep, Pondicherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli have enacted and\nimplemented groundwater legislation. However, the effectiveness of their implementation and enforcement is not known.\nIt is often the shortage of electricity that prompts supply restrictions and reduced\nexploitation of water. Restricted power supply policy was observed to have little\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n165\n\nconsequence in the case of large pumps and multiple wells as the effectiveness of\nregulations undermines not only the availability of the diesel pump-set option but\nalso by the presence of a \u2018kink\u2019 in the farmers\u2019 power demands (Saleth 2005). As a\nresult, misuse of power as well as groundwater is wide spread, as farmers leave their\npumps on round the clock. The combined impact of free and limited power supply\non groundwater use needs to be assessed critically.\nIn the case of credit regulation field research has shown that it was not very\neffective due to the availability of other credit avenues (mainly informal sources) at\nthe village level (Kumar 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2448b677-d601-40e6-90ad-ddbb006cc28d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2448b677-d601-40e6-90ad-ddbb006cc28d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3cc37e8-978f-4e38-9913-25e124640230", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f122b39c58014f5e3acbeb8a0798f8f1a8f857c1362beb145346ee4528a063f"}, "3": {"node_id": "18f4a7c8-3b62-4ce5-a1c1-359de890e4a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91703f90d33fd48fd57542724b4f2b434d29fd36e90bff0e0ffe1dd9ad6173ca"}}, "hash": "d4e92d1e99267c8449f2bc9f028ba45ee9ae520d8531363afd3ccf850e0c1c90", "text": "This is despite the fact that cost of credit is high for\nthe informal sources. Credit rationing policy of the bank is also trying to curb new\npower connection to bore-wells and put restrictions on electric power supply.\nBesides, enforcement is also lax due to the pressure on banks to achieve targets.\nSome success in reducing groundwater draft through regulatory measures have\nreportedly been made in a few water-scarce countries such as Jordan, where a quasi\nwater policy requires measuring withdrawals from the irrigation wells, enforcement\nof pumping quotas and levy of volumetric groundwater fee (World Bank 2000). But,\nthe situation is more complex in countries such as India where millions of individual private tube well owners, dispersed through the length and breadth of the country with varying groundwater availability and demand conditions, are engaged in\ngroundwater extraction. Putting into effect such an approach and overseeing its\nimplementation in a country of the size of India is nearly impossible. For, the number of groundwater structures in India is estimated at about 23\u201325 million (World\nBank 2010).\nMaharashtra has recently developed a groundwater management model which\ninvolves regulation of more than 1.5 million irrigation wells. It includes a levy of\ngroundwater use and a ban on deep tube wells. The Chinese, with stronger state\ncommitment to groundwater regulation, with a more elaborate reach and local\nauthority structures have still found it impossible to regulate groundwater overdraft\nin North China Plains (Shah et al. 2004). Nor have the Americans been able to\nimplement real groundwater demand management with their elaborate structure or\nwater rights and groundwater districts, nor have Spaniards and Mexicans with their\nefforts to promote groundwater user associations.\nIt is estimated that micro irrigation systems save 48\u201367 % in terms water and\n44\u201367 % in terms of energy and 29\u201360 % in terms of labour. Farmers have also\nreported low incidence of pest attack, reduced weed growth, improvement in soil\nquality and increased yields. As a result net incomes have increased substantially\nand farmers are interested in investing on their own without any subsidy. Costbenefit analysis of drip irrigation in Maharashtra revealed high economic viability\nfor banana, grapes and sugarcane (Narayanamoorthy 1997). The economic viability\nseems to hold good even in the case of small-holdings of just 1 ha. Despite the high\neconomic viability the spread of these technologies is limited due to high initial cost\nand lack of awareness. The rationale of subsidies for these technologies is valid not\nonly for spreading of these technologies but also due to the reason that social returns\nare far in excess of private returns accruing to drip investors (Dhawan 2000).\nBesides, there is need for strong extension support for better adoption rates.

These include: (a) proper valuation\nof water resources (i.e., use value + scarcity value + existence value), (b) institutional mechanisms like water user associations to support implementations of pricing policies, (c) technologies to enhance water productivity and (d) property rights\nin water so that water is tradable and reallocated for other productive uses. More\nimportantly, in most cases optimum or marginal pricing of water is neither determined nor implemented. In the absence of optimal or threshold level pricing, its\nimpact on demand is limited. The threshold pricing that would influence demand is\noften high making it politically sensitive to implement. Evidence in India shows\nthat water pricing barely covers the O and M expenditure even in the reform states\nwhere prices have been revised, let alone influencing water demand (Reddy 2003,\n2010).\nIn the case of groundwater, water productivity impacts of pricing would be the\nhighest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. An effective power\ntariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n167\n\nthe issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India (Kumar\n2005). Similarly, in the context of Andhra Pradesh, which is the front runner in the\nprovision of free power along with supply restrictions, it is argued that pricing of\nelectricity for irrigation is the only option for addressing agrarian distress (Kumar\net al. 2011). However, impact of pricing on groundwater management could vary\ndepending on the water productivity (Malik n.d.). In the case of diesel pricing it was\nfound that price rise may not necessarily result in the reduction in groundwater use\n(Shah 2007). On the contrary, farmers may apt for high water intensive and high\nremunerative crops.\nThe impact of water markets on groundwater demand is not necessarily negative. Though, markets encourage groundwater use efficiency, they often expand the\narea per well due to the incentive to sell water. However, the extent of the impact\nagain may depend on the water productivity. Groundwater market in Gujarat, for\ninstance, does not consider the limit of the resources and thus is not sustainable over\nthe long run (Kemper 2007). Topography and distance between the source and the\nfield also influences sustainability. In hard rock, deep alluvial or scanty rainfall\nareas, development of market sharing results in over-pumping and over-exploitation. On the other hand, Shah (2009) mentions that tradable property ownership\ncreates incentives for improving productivity and conservation.\nParticipatory groundwater Management or Social regulation1 appears to be\nmore effective in influencing water demand though evidence is limited at this stage.\nAvailable empirical studies show that in the years when water availability was low\ndue to either low rainfall or high groundwater abstraction during the preceding\ncrop season are now able to achieve a combination of crop diversification and\nwater-saving irrigation methods through participatory management (World Bank\n2010). A similar experience in Gujarat shows that even though power supply has\ndecreased from 18\u201320 to 8 h, community participation in groundwater management raised aquifer recharge where farmers are able to cultivate four good seasons\nin a row (Shah et al. 2002).\nParticipatory groundwater management is evolving gradually in India. It essentially involves communities observing groundwater variables and attempting locallevel, groundwater planning and management. This effort is aimed at augmentation,\nconservation and improving patterns of groundwater use (Table 9.2). All these initiatives are diverse in terms of their scale (village, aquifer, watershed) and approach\n(farmers collecting data, well drillers providing information, hydrogeologists carrying out surveys, local youth being trained to map the geology). They have a common purpose i.e., to drive a knowledge-based, localized management of groundwater\nresources that emerges as a consequence of decisions taken at the scale of a village\nor micro watershed and decisions based on some degree of scientific understanding\nof groundwater resources. Of course, it goes without saying that the involvement of\nGovernment institutions in such initiatives would greatly help in the scaling up of\n1\n\nThis section draws from an earlier publication Reddy, V.

While such an awareness has helped in checking further expansion of groundwater development i.e., new wells, it failed to encourage other conservation practices\nlike increased investments in recharge structures or equity by sharing the water with\nun-irrigated farmers. Though our sample village does not provide any evidence on\nthe reduction in water intensive crops (paddy), it is achieved in other places (Reddy\n2012).

While the\nfarmers hither to not having wells are dissuaded from digging new wells (through\ninformation based awareness), there is no incentive for them to support the initiative. In fact, they are not even members of the committee.\nOur qualitative research indicated that farmers are very much interested in having\ninstitutional arrangements in the lines of APFAMGS for managing groundwater.\nBut sustainability of APFAMGS initiative is a big question mark in the absence of\nlinkages with formal institutions with policy or legislative backing at the movement.2 Moreover, the exit protocol is not clearly defined. In number of villages the\nactivities of APFAMGS came to stand still during the two years gap (2009\u20132011)\ndue to the delay in the extension of the project. One suggestion made by farmers in\nthis regard is to bring the initiative under the groundwater department\u2019s purview so\nthat the process would continue in the long run (Reddy et al. 2011).\n\n9.3.2\n\nSocial Regulation Approach\n\nThe other two models viz., SRWM and APDAI have adopted social regulation to\nmanage groundwater. Though awareness building and data generation by the village\ncommunities are important components, the process is not so systematic. The most\nimportant aspect of these two models is to bring consensus among the communities\nto share water between well owners and others. Incentives like reduced risk of well\nfailure as no new wells are allowed, subsidies for micro irrigation, provision for\nprotective irrigation to the dry plots of the well owners, and the irrigation backup\nthey get in the event of well failure, are put in place. Besides, there is financial\nprovision for water harvesting structures to increase recharge, laying pipe lines\nfor water supply to reduce distribution losses and promotion of micro irrigation\n(subsidies) in order to enhance water use efficiency.\nSocial regulation appears to be effective in terms of stopping new bore wells as\nwell as larger number of households, especially marginal and small, are benefiting\nfrom sharing water with well owners.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60d5677b-4013-4748-b392-ea919cf063ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "60d5677b-4013-4748-b392-ea919cf063ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b7bbec1-a67e-473d-82a8-c01a7fbea5ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4590a42d738a09b0eea5ca944bc683f5ddc33abe269b19f172526a9e35901cc9"}, "3": {"node_id": "39d5b8fa-4d28-4548-a7af-6033c23a34ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aae8e0611314dc81d26fa7b84b8fe6c68801a2be92e0c574aa5e94f1d109ba7e"}}, "hash": "ec4ff16f7d6af92c3bfa13af0b1ab7a15db538a618a74de6426ff3480ff806b1", "text": "This not only helped in increasing the cropped\narea, but also provided protective irrigation to number of plots during critical periods thus saving the crops. This also resulted in equity in the distribution of water\nand overall improvement in welfare. However, there are differences between the\ntwo models of social regulation in terms of their effectiveness. The SRWM appears\nto be more effective when compared to APDAI. One reason could be that SRWM is\nolder, followed an intensive approach and worked with smaller groups of farmers\nthan APDAI initiative. Though APDAI mostly follows the SRWM approach, it has\nadopted a broader (area based) and formal approach involving the department\n(Table 9.4). Besides, groundwater management is one of the pilots under APDAI\nand hence there are chances of dilution as far as the departmental involvement\nis concerned.\n2\n\nThough HUNs are registered bodies and can take up activities like input procurement, output\nmarketing, etc, they are yet to be functional in these activities.\n\n \n9 Regulatory Instruments and Demand Management of Water: Potential and Prospects\n\n173\n\nDespite the formal approach, participation and rule following is limited in the\nAPDAI case. People indicated that there are no tangible benefits from the initiative\nand 50 % of the farmers felt that the institutional arrangements are not feasible\n(Reddy et al. 2012). This view is more conspicuous among those sharing wells. This\nsceptical nature could be due to the larger contribution (75 %) from the farmers,\nwhich is substantial (total costs are 8\u201310 thousand per acre). On the other hand, the\napproach of peoples\u2019 contribution could provide the much needed ownership and\nsustainability.3 It is observed that the formal process of entering an agreement with the\nwitness of Tahsildar has also discouraged some villages from joining the initiative.\nThe formal approach of APDAI appears good on paper, as it follows an integrated approach of drought adaptation. The integration also involves various departments like rural development, groundwater, agriculture, etc., but the feasibility of\nsuch integration is doubtful. The approach involves the existing institutions like\nMahila Samakhyas, which provide the assurance of sustenance in the medium run\nat least. At the same time there is a danger of acquiring the stamp of a government\nprogramme where people look for freebies rather than regulation and contribution.\nOn the whole, the social regulation approach seems to work better for sustainable\ngroundwater management when compared to the knowledge intensive approach.\nWater use and sharing through regulation has increased the area under protective\nirrigation in an equitable manner. The knowledge intensive approach is not designed\nto address equity. In the absence of any regulations, formal or informal, farmers do\nnot have any incentive to follow good practices in the given policy environment.\nEncouraging sharing of water between well owners and others would result in\nachieving double objectives of conservation and improved access with equity. How\nto attain this on scale needs serious consideration at the policy level.\nSustainability of these initiatives is a major concern in all the approaches. None\nof the approaches have a well defined exit protocol. While the APDAI appears to be\nwell placed in this regard as its process involves number of departments and formal\ninstitutions. At the same time it requires strong leadership at the village level to\nimplement and take the initiative forward, especially in the context of peoples\u2019 contribution. In the case of SRWM, its present success is mainly due to the commitment\nof NGO partners in the absence of any contribution from the farmers. In the absence\nof contribution, financial sustainability of the initiatives would be a big concern,\nespecially once the external funding stops. The week sustainability of APFAMGS\ninitiative was already evident during the no fund phase. Fund flows appear to be\ncritical for the success of the initiatives. The initiatives may continue in some of\nthe villages due to strong leadership and commitment of local NGOs even beyond\nthe present funding, as they are at a smaller scale. Scaling up of these initiatives\nrequire much more planning and designing.\n\n3\n\nOf late people\u2019s contribution in the government programmes has lost its importance, as people are\nincreasing considering government programmes as welfare measures rather than developmental.\nAnd hence contribution is treated as negative rather than ownership.\n\n \n174\n\n9.4\n\nV.R. Reddy\n\nLessons for Future\n\nThe review of the role of regulatory instruments in managing demand for water\nacross the countries indicate that there is evidence to say that the commonly used\ninstruments like pricing, supply regulation, direct and indirect policy regulation,\netc., have not been effective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39d5b8fa-4d28-4548-a7af-6033c23a34ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "39d5b8fa-4d28-4548-a7af-6033c23a34ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99266f78-f3be-4c34-8bcf-148c26cc6d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76788308232c854483f4cae60aab240c1aa16976e23e347ebc52293fbbbeb81d"}, "2": {"node_id": "60d5677b-4013-4748-b392-ea919cf063ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec4ff16f7d6af92c3bfa13af0b1ab7a15db538a618a74de6426ff3480ff806b1"}}, "hash": "aae8e0611314dc81d26fa7b84b8fe6c68801a2be92e0c574aa5e94f1d109ba7e", "text": "This is more so in India due to complex socioeconomic\nand resource systems and environment. Often policies are neither comprehensive\nnor they work in tandem. On the contrary they work towards opposite objectives,\nviz., water conservation policies like promoting low water intensive crops are made\nineffective through support price policies that encourage water intensive crops like\npaddy and free power policies. Unless policy, economic and institutional regulations complement each other, the scope for achieving sustainable and efficient water\nmanagement is a far cry. Moreover, none of the regulatory instruments have equity\nin-built in to them. Whatever equity impacts evident seems to be rather incidental.\nFor instance, regulated power supply has checked degradation of groundwater to\nsome extent, which in turn reduced well failure among small farmers. Similarly,\nregulation of water distribution by WUAs has also improved the access to tail end\nfarmers, who are often small and marginal. At the same time increased inequity is\nobserved in the context of WUAs in Orissa.\nThe assessment of three community based models has also clearly indicated that\nachieving sustainability and equity objectives is neither simple nor easily forthcoming.
